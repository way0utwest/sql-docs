# Lesson 9: Defining Perspectives and Translations
[!INCLUDE[ssas-appliesto-sqlas](../includes/ssas-appliesto-sqlas.md)]
In this lesson, you learn to define perspectives and translations. You can define perspectives to reduce the apparent complexity of a cube, and define translations that let users view the cube metadata in the language of their choice.
