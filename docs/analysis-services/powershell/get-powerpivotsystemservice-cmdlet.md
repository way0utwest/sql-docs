# Get-PowerPivotSystemService cmdlet
[!INCLUDE[ssas-appliesto-sqlas](../../includes/ssas-appliesto-sqlas.md)]
  Returns the global properties of the [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../includes/ssgemini-md.md)] System Service object in a farm. 

>[!NOTE] 
>This article may contain outdated information and examples. Use the Get-Help cmdlet for the latest.
  
 **Applies To:** SharePoint 2010 and SharePoint 2013.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
Get-PowerPivotSystemService [-Identity <PowerPivotMidTierServicePipeBind>] [<CommonParameters>]  
```  
  
## Description  
 The Get-PowerPivotSystemService cmdlet returns the global properties of the [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../includes/ssgemini-md.md)] System Service object. There is one parent object per farm, but each farm can have multiple instances of the [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../includes/ssgemini-md.md)] System Service that run on individual application servers in the farm. The parent object shows farm-level settings that do not vary by instance. If the farm includes multiple [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../includes/ssgemini-md.md)] for SharePoint installations, a comma-delimited list of the instances will indicate how many [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../includes/ssgemini-md.md)] System Service instances are in the farm.  
  
## Parameters  
  
### -Identity \<PowerPivotMidTierServicePipeBind>  
 Specifies the parent object to get. The value must be a valid GUID that uniquely identifies the object in the farm.
