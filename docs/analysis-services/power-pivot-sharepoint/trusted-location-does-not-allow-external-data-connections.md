# Trusted location does not allow external data connections
[!INCLUDE[ssas-appliesto-sqlas](../../includes/ssas-appliesto-sqlas.md)]
  For Excel workbooks that contain [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../includes/ssgemini-md.md)] data, Excel Services returns this error if it cannot connect to embedded data sources.  
  
## Details  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|Applies to|[!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../includes/ssgemini-md.md)] for SharePoint|  
|Product Version|[!INCLUDE[ssKilimanjaro](../../includes/sskilimanjaro-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../includes/sssql11-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../../includes/sssql14-md.md)]|  
|Cause|Excel Services is configured to deny external data access.|  
|Message Text|The trusted location where the workbook is stored does not allow external data connections. The following connections failed to refresh: [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../includes/ssgemini-md.md)] Data|  
  
## Explanation  
 [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../includes/ssgemini-md.md)] workbooks contain embedded data connections. To support workbook interaction through slicers and filters, Excel Services must be configured to allow external data access through embedded connection information. External data access is required for retrieving [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../includes/ssgemini-md.md)] data that is loaded on [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../includes/ssgemini-md.md)] servers in the farm.  
  
## User Action  
 Change the configuration settings to allow embedded data sources.  
  
1.  In Central Administration, in Application Management, click **Manage service applications**.  
  
2.  Click **Excel Services Application**.  
  
3.  Click **Trusted File Location**.  
  
4.  Click **http://** or the location you want to configure.  
  
5.  In External Data, in Allow External Data, click **Trusted data connection libraries and embedded**.  
  
6.  Click **OK**.  
  
 Alternatively, you can create a new trusted location for sites that contain [!INCLUDE[ssGemini](../../includes/ssgemini-md.md)] workbooks, and then modify the configuration settings for just that site. For more information, see [Create a trusted location for Power Pivot sites in Central Administration](../../analysis-services/power-pivot-sharepoint/create-a-trusted-location-for-power-pivot-sites-in-central-administration.md).
