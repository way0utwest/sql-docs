# SMO Programming Languages
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]
  This section describes how to program [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Management Objects (SMO) in [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] Visual C# .NET.
  
|Topic|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|[Getting Started in Visual C&#35; .NET](../../relational-databases/server-management-objects-smo/smo-programming-getting-started-in-visual-csharp-net.md)|Provides information on how to start writing an SMO program in Visual C# .NET|  
  
 SMO is a .NET assembly. To program by using the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] .NET Framework, you must choose a language that is supported by the common language runtime. In the SMO reference, there is syntax for managed languages such as Visual C# .NET.
