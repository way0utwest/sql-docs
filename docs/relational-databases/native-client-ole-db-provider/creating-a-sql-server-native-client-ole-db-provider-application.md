# Creating a SQL Server Native Client OLE DB Provider Application
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-asdb-asdw-pdw-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-asdb-asdw-pdw-md.md)]
[!INCLUDE[SNAC_Deprecated](../../includes/snac-deprecated.md)]

  Creating a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client OLE DB provider application involves these steps:  
  
1.  Establishing a connection to a data source.  
  
2.  Executing a command.  
  
3.  Processing the results.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  When possible, use Windows Authentication. If Windows Authentication is not available, prompt users to enter their credentials at run time. Avoid storing credentials in a file. If you must persist credentials, you should encrypt them with [the Win32 cryptoAPI](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=9504).
