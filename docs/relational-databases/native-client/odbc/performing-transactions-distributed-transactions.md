# Performing Transactions - Distributed Transactions
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-asdb-asdw-pdw-md](../../../includes/appliesto-ss-asdb-asdw-pdw-md.md)]
[!INCLUDE[SNAC_Deprecated](../../../includes/snac-deprecated.md)]

  The Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator (MS DTC) allows applications to extend transactions across two or more instances of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. It also allows applications to participate in transactions managed by transaction managers that comply with the Open Group DTP XA standard.  
  
 Normally, all transaction management commands are sent through the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client ODBC driver to the server. The application starts a transaction by calling [SQLSetConnectAttr](../../../relational-databases/native-client-odbc-api/sqlsetconnectattr.md) with the autocommit mode turned off. The application then performs the updates comprising the transaction and calls [SQLEndTran](../../../relational-databases/native-client-odbc-api/sqlendtran.md) with either the SQL_COMMIT or SQL_ROLLBACK option.  
  
 When using MS DTC, however, MS DTC becomes the transaction manager and the application no longer uses **SQLEndTran**.  
  
 When enlisted in a distributed transaction, and then enlist in a second distributed transaction, the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client ODBC Driver defects from the original distributed transaction and enlists in the new transaction. For more information, see [DTC Programmer's Reference](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms686108\(VS.85\).aspx).
