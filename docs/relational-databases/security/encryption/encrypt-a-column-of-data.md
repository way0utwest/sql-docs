# Encrypt a Column of Data
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-asdb-xxxx-xxx-md](../../../includes/appliesto-ss-asdb-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  This topic describes how to encrypt a column of data by using symmetric encryption in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] using [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../../includes/tsql-md.md)]. This is sometimes known as column-level encryption, or cell-level encryption.

####  <a name="Permissions"></a> Permissions  
 The following permissions are necessary to perform the steps below:  
  
-   CONTROL permission on the database.  
  
-   CREATE CERTIFICATE permission on the database. Only Windows logins, SQL Server logins, and application roles can own certificates. Groups and roles cannot own certificates.  
  
-   ALTER permission on the table.  
  
-   Some permission on the key and must not have been denied VIEW DEFINITION permission.  
  
##  <a name="TsqlProcedure"></a> Using Transact-SQL  

To use the following examples you must have a database master key. If your database does not already have a database master key, create one by executing the following statement providing your password:   
```  
CREATE MASTER KEY ENCRYPTION BY   
PASSWORD = '<some strong password>';  
```  
Always backup your database master key. For more information on database master keys, see [CREATE MASTER KEY &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../../t-sql/statements/create-master-key-transact-sql.md).

#### To encrypt a column of data using a simple symmetric encryption  
  
1.  In **Object Explorer**, connect to an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../../includes/ssde-md.md)].  
  
2.  On the Standard bar, click **New Query**.  
  
3.  Copy and paste the following example into the query window and click **Execute**.  
  
    ```  
    USE AdventureWorks2012;  
    
    GO  
  
    CREATE CERTIFICATE Sales09  
       WITH SUBJECT = 'Customer Credit Card Numbers';  
    GO  
  
    CREATE SYMMETRIC KEY CreditCards_Key11  
        WITH ALGORITHM = AES_256  
        ENCRYPTION BY CERTIFICATE Sales09;  
    GO  
  
    -- Create a column in which to store the encrypted data.  
    ALTER TABLE Sales.CreditCard   
        ADD CardNumber_Encrypted varbinary(128);   
    GO  
  
    -- Open the symmetric key with which to encrypt the data.  
    OPEN SYMMETRIC KEY CreditCards_Key11  
       DECRYPTION BY CERTIFICATE Sales09;  
  
    -- Encrypt the value in column CardNumber using the  
    -- symmetric key CreditCards_Key11.  
    -- Save the result in column CardNumber_Encrypted.    
    UPDATE Sales.CreditCard  
    SET CardNumber_Encrypted = EncryptByKey(Key_GUID('CreditCards_Key11')  
        , CardNumber, 1, HashBytes('SHA1', CONVERT( varbinary  
        , CreditCardID)));  
    GO  
  
    -- Verify the encryption.  
    -- First, open the symmetric key with which to decrypt the data.  
  
    OPEN SYMMETRIC KEY CreditCards_Key11  
       DECRYPTION BY CERTIFICATE Sales09;  
    GO  
  
    -- Now list the original card number, the encrypted card number,  
    -- and the decrypted ciphertext. If the decryption worked,  
    -- the original number will match the decrypted number.  
  
    SELECT CardNumber, CardNumber_Encrypted   
        AS 'Encrypted card number', CONVERT(nvarchar,  
        DecryptByKey(CardNumber_Encrypted, 1 ,   
        HashBytes('SHA1', CONVERT(varbinary, CreditCardID))))  
        AS 'Decrypted card number' FROM Sales.CreditCard;  
    GO  
    ```  
  
#### To encrypt a column of data using symmetric encryption that includes an authenticator  
  
1.  In **Object Explorer**, connect to an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../../includes/ssde-md.md)].  
  
2.  On the Standard bar, click **New Query**.  
  
3.  Copy and paste the following example into the query window and click **Execute**.  
  
    ```  
    USE AdventureWorks2012;  
    GO  
  
    CREATE CERTIFICATE HumanResources037  
       WITH SUBJECT = 'Employee Social Security Numbers';  
    GO  
  
    CREATE SYMMETRIC KEY SSN_Key_01  
        WITH ALGORITHM = AES_256  
        ENCRYPTION BY CERTIFICATE HumanResources037;  
    GO  
  
    USE [AdventureWorks2012];  
    GO  
  
    -- Create a column in which to store the encrypted data.  
    ALTER TABLE HumanResources.Employee  
        ADD EncryptedNationalIDNumber varbinary(128);   
    GO  
  
    -- Open the symmetric key with which to encrypt the data.  
    OPEN SYMMETRIC KEY SSN_Key_01  
       DECRYPTION BY CERTIFICATE HumanResources037;  
  
    -- Encrypt the value in column NationalIDNumber with symmetric   
    -- key SSN_Key_01. Save the result in column EncryptedNationalIDNumber.  
    UPDATE HumanResources.Employee  
    SET EncryptedNationalIDNumber = EncryptByKey(Key_GUID('SSN_Key_01'), NationalIDNumber);  
    GO  
  
    -- Verify the encryption.  
    -- First, open the symmetric key with which to decrypt the data.  
    OPEN SYMMETRIC KEY SSN_Key_01  
       DECRYPTION BY CERTIFICATE HumanResources037;  
    GO  
  
    -- Now list the original ID, the encrypted ID, and the   
    -- decrypted ciphertext. If the decryption worked, the original  
    -- and the decrypted ID will match.  
    SELECT NationalIDNumber, EncryptedNationalIDNumber   
        AS 'Encrypted ID Number',  
        CONVERT(nvarchar, DecryptByKey(EncryptedNationalIDNumber))   
        AS 'Decrypted ID Number'  
        FROM HumanResources.Employee;  
    GO  
    ```
