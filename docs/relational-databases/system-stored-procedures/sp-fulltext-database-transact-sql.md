# sp_fulltext_database (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-asdb-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-asdb-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Has no effect on full-text catalogs in [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../includes/sskatmai-md.md)] and later versions and is supported for backward compatibility only. **sp_fulltext_database** does not disable the Full-Text Engine for a given database. All user-created databases in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] are always enabled for full-text indexing.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  [!INCLUDE[ssNoteDepFutureDontUse](../../includes/ssnotedepfuturedontuse-md.md)] Use [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../includes/ssmanstudio-md.md)] instead.

## Syntax  
  
```  
  
sp_fulltext_database [@action=] 'action'  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 [ **@action=**] **'***action***'**  
 Is the action to be performed. **action** is **varchar(20)**, and can be one of these values.  
  
|Value|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|**enable**|Supported for backward compatibility only. Has no effect on full-text catalogs in [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../includes/sskatmai-md.md)] and later versions.|  
|**disable**|Supported for backward compatibility only. Has no effect on full-text catalogs in [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../includes/sskatmai-md.md)] and later versions.|  
  
## Return Code Values  
 0 (success) or 1 (failure)  
  
## Result Sets  
 None  
  
## Remarks  
 In [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../includes/sskatmai-md.md)] and later versions, full-text indexing cannot be turned off. Disabling full-text indexing does not remove rows from **sysfulltextcatalogs** and does not indicate that full-text enabled tables are no longer marked for full-text indexing. All the full-text metadata definitions are still in the system tables.  
  
## Permissions  
 Only members of the **sysadmin** fixed server role and **db_owner** fixed database role can execute **sp_fulltext_database**.
