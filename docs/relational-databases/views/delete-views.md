# Delete Views
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-asdb-asdw-pdw-md](../../includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-asdb-asdw-pdw-md.md)]
  You can delete (drop) views in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] by using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)]

##  <a name="BeforeYouBegin"></a> Before You Begin  
  
###  <a name="Restrictions"></a> Limitations and Restrictions  
  
-   When you drop a view, the definition of the view and other information about the view is deleted from the system catalog. All permissions for the view are also deleted.  
  
-   Any view on a table that is dropped by using `DROP TABLE` must be dropped explicitly by using `DROP VIEW`.  
  
###  <a name="Security"></a> Security  
  
####  <a name="Permissions"></a> Permissions  
 Requires ALTER permission on SCHEMA or CONTROL permission on OBJECT.  
  
##  <a name="SSMSProcedure"></a> Using SQL Server Management Studio  
  
#### To delete a view from a database  
  
1.  In **Object Explorer**, expand the database that contains the view you want to delete, and then expand the **Views** folder.  
  
2.  Right-click the view you want to delete and click **Delete**.  
  
3.  In the **Delete Object** dialog box, click **OK**.  
  
    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    >  Click **Show Dependencies** in the **Delete Object** dialog box to open the *view_name***Dependencies** dialog box. This will show all of the objects that depend on the view and all of the objects on which the view depends.  
  
##  <a name="TsqlProcedure"></a> Using Transact-SQL  
  
#### To delete a view from a database  
  
1.  In **Object Explorer**, connect to an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)].  
  
2.  On the Standard bar, click **New Query**.  
  
3.  Copy and paste the following example into the query window and click **Execute**. The example deletes the specified view only if the view already exists.  
  
    ```  
    USE AdventureWorks2012 ;  
    GO  
    IF OBJECT_ID ('HumanResources.EmployeeHireDate', 'V') IS NOT NULL  
    DROP VIEW HumanResources.EmployeeHireDate;  
    GO  
    ```
