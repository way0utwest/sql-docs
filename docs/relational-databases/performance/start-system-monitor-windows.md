# Start System Monitor (Windows)
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]
  Use System Monitor to monitor the utilization of system resources. Collect and view real-time performance data in the form of counters. You can use counters for server resources, such as processor and memory use. You also can use them for many Microsoft [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] resources, such as locks and transactions.  
  
## Start System Monitor in Windows  
  
On the **Start** menu, point to **Run**, type **perfmon** in the **Run** dialog box, and then select **OK**.
