# sys.dm_db_persisted_sku_features (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Some features of the [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)] change the way that [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] stores information in the database files. These features are restricted to specific editions of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. A database that contains these features cannot be moved to an edition of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] that does not support them. Use the sys.dm_db_persisted_sku_features dynamic management view to list edition-specific features that are enabled in the current database.
  
**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] ([!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../includes/sskatmai-md.md)] through [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)]).
  
|Column name|Data type|Description|  
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|  
|feature_name|**sysname**|External name of the feature that is enabled in the database but not supported on the all the editions of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. This feature must be removed before the database can be migrated to all available editions of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].|  
|feature_id|**int**|Feature ID that is associated with the feature. [!INCLUDE[ssInternalOnly](../../includes/ssinternalonly-md.md)].|  
  
## Permissions  
 Requires VIEW DATABASE STATE permission on the database.  
  
## Remarks  
 If no features that may be restricted by a specific edition are used by the database, the view returns no rows.  
  
 sys.dm_db_persisted_sku_features may list the following database-changing features as restricted to specific [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] editions:  
  
-   **ChangeCapture**: Indicates that a database has change data capture enabled. To remove change data capture, use the [sys.sp_cdc_disable_db](../../relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sys-sp-cdc-disable-db-transact-sql.md) stored procedure. For more information, see [About Change Data Capture &#40;SQL Server&#41;](../../relational-databases/track-changes/about-change-data-capture-sql-server.md).  
  
-   **ColumnStoreIndex**: Indicates that at least one table has a columnstore index. To enable a database to be moved to an edition of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] that does not support this feature, use the [DROP INDEX](../../t-sql/statements/drop-index-transact-sql.md) or [ALTER INDEX](../../t-sql/statements/alter-index-transact-sql.md) statement to remove the columnstore index. For more information, see [Columnstore indexes](../../relational-databases/indexes/columnstore-indexes-overview.md).  
  
    **Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] ([!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../includes/sssql11-md.md)] through [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)]).  
  
-   **Compression**: Indicates that at least one table or index uses data compression or the vardecimal storage format. To enable a database to be moved to an edition of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] that does not support this feature, use the [ALTER TABLE](../../t-sql/statements/alter-table-transact-sql.md) or [ALTER INDEX](../../t-sql/statements/alter-index-transact-sql.md) statement to remove data compression. To remove vardecimal storage format, use the sp_tableoption statement. For more information, see [Data Compression](../../relational-databases/data-compression/data-compression.md).  
  
-   **MultipleFSContainers**: Indicates that the database uses multiple FILESTREAM containers. The database has a FILESTREAM filegroup with multiple containers (files). For more information, see [FILESTREAM &#40;SQL Server&#41;](../../relational-databases/blob/filestream-sql-server.md).  
  
-   **InMemoryOLTP**: Indicates that the database uses In-Memory OLTP. The database has a MEMORY_OPTIMIZED_DATA filegroup. For more information, see [In-Memory OLTP &#40;In-Memory Optimization&#41;](../../relational-databases/in-memory-oltp/in-memory-oltp-in-memory-optimization.md).  
  
  **Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] ([!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../../includes/sssql14-md.md)] through [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)]). 
  
-   **Partitioning.** Indicates that the database contains partitioned tables, partitioned indexes, partition schemes, or partition functions. To enable a database to be moved to an edition of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] other than Enterprise or Developer, it is insufficient to modify the table to be on a single partition. You must remove the partitioned table. If the table contains data, use SWITCH PARTITION to convert each partition into a nonpartitioned table. Then delete the partitioned table, the partition scheme, and the partition function.  
  
-   **TransparentDataEncryption.** Indicates that a database is encrypted by using transparent data encryption. To remove transparent data encryption, use the ALTER DATABASE statement. For more information, see [Transparent Data Encryption &#40;TDE&#41;](../../relational-databases/security/encryption/transparent-data-encryption.md).  

> [!NOTE]
> Starting with [!INCLUDE[ssSQL15](../../includes/sssql15-md.md)] Service Pack 1, these features are available across multiple [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Editions, and not limited to Enterprise or Developer Editions only.

 To determine whether a database uses any features that are restricted to specific editions, execute the following statement in the database:  
  
```sql  
SELECT feature_name FROM sys.dm_db_persisted_sku_features;  
GO  
```
