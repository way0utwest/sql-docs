# sys.dm_os_buffer_descriptors (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-asdb-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-asdb-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Returns information about all the data pages that are currently in the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] buffer pool. The output of this view can be used to determine the distribution of database pages in the buffer pool according to database, object, or type. In [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)], this dynamic management view also returns information about the data pages in the buffer pool extension file. For more information, see [Buffer Pool Extension](../../database-engine/configure-windows/buffer-pool-extension.md).  
  
 When a data page is read from disk, the page is copied into the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] buffer pool and cached for reuse. Each cached data page has one buffer descriptor. Buffer descriptors uniquely identify each data page that is currently cached in an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. sys.dm_os_buffer_descriptors returns cached pages for all user and system databases. This includes pages that are associated with the Resource database.  
  
> **NOTE:** To call this from [!INCLUDE[ssSDWfull](../../includes/sssdwfull-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[ssPDW](../../includes/sspdw-md.md)], use the name **sys.dm_pdw_nodes_os_buffer_descriptors**.  
  
|Column name|Data type|Description|  
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|  
|database_id|**int**|ID of database associated with the page in the buffer pool. Is nullable.|  
|file_id|**int**|ID of the file that stores the persisted image of the page. Is nullable.|  
|page_id|**int**|ID of the page within the file. Is nullable.|  
|page_level|**int**|Index level of the page. Is nullable.|  
|allocation_unit_id|**bigint**|ID of the allocation unit of the page. This value can be used to join sys.allocation_units. Is nullable.|  
|page_type|**nvarchar(60)**|Type of the page, such as: Data page or Index page. Is nullable.|  
|row_count|**int**|Number of rows on the page. Is nullable.|  
|free_space_in_bytes|**int**|Amount of available free space, in bytes, on the page. Is nullable.|  
|is_modified|**bit**|1 = Page has been modified after it was read from the disk. Is nullable.|  
|numa_node|**int**|Nonuniform Memory Access node for the buffer. Is nullable.|  
|read_microsec|**bigint**|The actual time (in microseconds) required to read the page into the buffer. This number is reset when the buffer is reused. Is nullable.|  
|is_in_bpool_extension|**bit**|1 = Page is in buffer pool extension. Is nullable.|  
|pdw_node_id|**int**|**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssSDWfull](../../includes/sssdwfull-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[ssPDW](../../includes/sspdw-md.md)]<br /><br /> The identifier for the node that this distribution is on.|  
  
## Permissions  
On [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion_md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], requires `VIEW SERVER STATE` permission.   
On [!INCLUDE[ssSDS_md](../../includes/sssds-md.md)] Premium Tiers, requires the `VIEW DATABASE STATE` permission in the database. On [!INCLUDE[ssSDS_md](../../includes/sssds-md.md)] Standard and Basic Tiers, requires the  **Server admin** or an **Azure Active Directory admin** account.  
  
## Remarks  
 sys.dm_os_buffer_descriptors returns pages that are being used by the Resource database. sys.dm_os_buffer_descriptors does not return information about free or stolen pages, or about pages that had errors when they were read.

## Examples  
  
### A. Returning cached page count for each database  
 The following example returns the count of pages loaded for each database.  
  
```  
SELECT COUNT(*)AS cached_pages_count  
    ,CASE database_id   
        WHEN 32767 THEN 'ResourceDb'   
        ELSE db_name(database_id)   
        END AS database_name  
FROM sys.dm_os_buffer_descriptors  
GROUP BY DB_NAME(database_id) ,database_id  
ORDER BY cached_pages_count DESC;  
```  
  
### B. Returning cached page count for each object in the current database  
 The following example returns the count of pages loaded for each object in the current database.  
  
```  
SELECT COUNT(*)AS cached_pages_count   
    ,name ,index_id   
FROM sys.dm_os_buffer_descriptors AS bd   
    INNER JOIN   
    (  
        SELECT object_name(object_id) AS name   
            ,index_id ,allocation_unit_id  
        FROM sys.allocation_units AS au  
            INNER JOIN sys.partitions AS p   
                ON au.container_id = p.hobt_id   
                    AND (au.type = 1 OR au.type = 3)  
        UNION ALL  
        SELECT object_name(object_id) AS name     
            ,index_id, allocation_unit_id  
        FROM sys.allocation_units AS au  
            INNER JOIN sys.partitions AS p   
                ON au.container_id = p.partition_id   
                    AND au.type = 2  
    ) AS obj   
        ON bd.allocation_unit_id = obj.allocation_unit_id  
WHERE database_id = DB_ID()  
GROUP BY name, index_id   
ORDER BY cached_pages_count DESC;  
```
