# ICommand (OLE DB)
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-asdb-asdw-pdw-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-asdb-asdw-pdw-md.md)]
[!INCLUDE[SNAC_Deprecated](../../includes/snac-deprecated.md)]

  This topic discusses OLE DB behavior that is specific to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client.  
  
## ICommand::Execute  
 Inserting data that is greater than the size of a column typically results in an error. However, there are situations where S_OK will be returned but the *dwStatus* will be set to DBSTATUS_S_TRUNCATED. This generally occurs when inserting data with parameters, where the column is not large enough to hold the data, and **ICommandWithParameters::SetParameterInfo** has not been called.
