# How Extended Stored Procedures Work
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

 The process by which an extended stored procedure works is:  
  
1.  When a client executes an extended stored procedure, the request is transmitted in tabular data stream (TDS) or Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) format from the client application to [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
2.  [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] searches for the DLL associated with the extended stored procedure, and loads the DLL if it is not already loaded.  
  
3.  [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] calls the requested extended stored procedure (implemented as a function inside the DLL).  
  
4.  The extended stored procedure passes result sets and return parameters back to the server by through the Extended Stored Procedure API.
