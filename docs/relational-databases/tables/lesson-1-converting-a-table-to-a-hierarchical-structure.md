# Lesson 1: Converting a Table to a Hierarchical Structure
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2012-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2012-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]
Customers who have tables using self joins to express hierarchical relationships can convert their tables to a hierarchical structure using this lesson as a guide. It is relatively easy to migrate from this representation to one using **hierarchyid**. After migration, users will have a compact and easy to understand hierarchical representation, which can be indexed in several ways for efficient queries.  
  
This lesson, examines an existing table, creates a new table containing a **hierarchyid** column, populates the table with the data from the source table, and then demonstrates three indexing strategies. This lesson contains the following topics:  
  
-   [Examining the Current Structure of the Employee Table](../../relational-databases/tables/lesson-1-1-examining-the-current-structure-of-the-employee-table.md)  
  
-   [Populating a Table with Existing Hierarchical Data](../../relational-databases/tables/lesson-1-2-populating-a-table-with-existing-hierarchical-data.md)  
  
-   [Optimizing the NewOrg Table](../../relational-databases/tables/lesson-1-3-optimizing-the-neworg-table.md)  
  
-   [Summary: Converting a Table to a Hierarchical Structure](../../relational-databases/tables/lesson-1-4-summary-converting-a-table-to-a-hierarchical-structure.md)  
  
## Prerequisites  
This lesson requires the [!INCLUDE[ssSampleDBobject](../../includes/sssampledbobject-md.md)] sample database.  
  
## Next Task in Lesson  
[Examining the Current Structure of the Employee Table](../../relational-databases/tables/lesson-1-1-examining-the-current-structure-of-the-employee-table.md)  
  
## Next Lesson  
[Lesson 2: Creating and Managing Data in a Hierarchical Table](../../relational-databases/tables/lesson-2-creating-and-managing-data-in-a-hierarchical-table.md)
