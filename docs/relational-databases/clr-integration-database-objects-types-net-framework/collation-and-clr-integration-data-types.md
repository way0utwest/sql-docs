# Collation and CLR Integration Data Types
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]
  In the [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)], the **CompareInfo** object handles collations. The [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] string application programming interfaces (APIs) use the **CompareInfo** property associated with the **CultureInfo** object of the current thread to perform string comparisons. The default setting of the **CultureInfo** object is based on the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] Windows locale setting for the computer on which [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is running. This determines the default comparison semantics, if no explicit **CultureInfo** is specified, for comparisons of **System.String** values. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] does not explicitly change the **CompareInfo** property to the database or server collation. If required, users must set the appropriate **CompareInfo** property in their routines.  
  
## Parameter Collation  
 When you create a common language runtime (CLR) routine, and a parameter of a CLR method bound to the routine is of type **SQLString**, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] creates an instance of the parameter with the default collation of the database containing the calling routine. If a parameter is not a **SqlType** (for example, **String** rather than **SQLString**), the collation information from the database is not associated with the parameter.
