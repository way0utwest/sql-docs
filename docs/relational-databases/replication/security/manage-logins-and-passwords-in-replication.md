# Manage Logins and Passwords in Replication
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md](../../../includes/appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]
  Specify the logins and passwords for replication agents when you configure replication. After configuring replication, you can change logins and passwords. For more information, see [View and Modify Replication Security Settings](../../../relational-databases/replication/security/view-and-modify-replication-security-settings.md). If you change the password for an account used by a replication agent, execute [sp_changereplicationserverpasswords &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../../relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-changereplicationserverpasswords-transact-sql.md).
