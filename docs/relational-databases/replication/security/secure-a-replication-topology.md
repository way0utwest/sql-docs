# Secure a Replication Topology
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md](../../../includes/appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]
  Security accounts, logins, and passwords required by replication are supplied when replication is configured and when publications and subscriptions are created. These security settings can be changed later using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)], replication stored procedures, and Replication Management Objects (RMO). The following topics describe how to modify replication security settings.
