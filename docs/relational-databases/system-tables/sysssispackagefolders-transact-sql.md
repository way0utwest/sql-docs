# sysssispackagefolders (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Contains one row for each logical folder in the folder hierarchy that [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] uses. These folders are listed in Object Explorer of [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] when you connect to [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)].

 The **parentfolderid** column describes the folder hierarchy. The folder at the top of the folder hierarchy contains a null value in **parentfolderid**.  
  
 The **foldername** column contains the name of folders that appear in Object Explorer.  
  
 This table is stored in the **msdb** database.
