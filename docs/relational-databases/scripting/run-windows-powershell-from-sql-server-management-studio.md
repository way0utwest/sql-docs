# Run Windows PowerShell from SQL Server Management Studio
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-asdb-asdw-pdw-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-asdb-asdw-pdw-md.md)]
  You can start Windows PowerShell sessions from **Object Explorer** in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)]. [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../includes/ssmanstudio-md.md)] launches Windows PowerShell, loads the **sqlps** module, and sets the path context to the associated node in the **Object Explorer** tree.  
  
## Before You Begin  
 When you specify running PowerShell for an object in **Object Explorer**, [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] starts a Windows PowerShell session in which the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] PowerShell snap-ins have been loaded and registered. The path for the session is preset to the location of the object you right clicked in Object Explorer. For example, if you right-click the [!INCLUDE[ssSampleDBobject](../../includes/sssampledbobject-md.md)] database object in Object Explorer and select **Start PowerShell**, the Windows PowerShell path is set to the following:  
  
```  
SQLSERVER:\SQL\MyComputer\MyInstance\Databases\AdventureWorks2012>  
```  
  
## Run PowerShell  
 **To run PowerShell from SQL Server Management Studio**  
  
1.  Open **Object Explorer**.  
  
2.  Navigate to the node for the object to be worked on.  
  
3.  Right-click the object and select **Start PowerShell**.  
  
## Permissions  
 When opened from [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../includes/ssmanstudio-md.md)], PowerShell does not run with Administrator privileges which may prevent some activities such as calls to WMI.
