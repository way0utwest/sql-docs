# Print Code and Results
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-asdb-asdw-pdw-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-asdb-asdw-pdw-md.md)]
  When you print a query or file, colorized elements print in color if your printer supports color printing and color printing is enabled in the printer setup.  
  
 However, the font and coloration of text in the Editor and the way that the text prints on the printer can differ. From the **Tools** menu, select **Options**. Under **Environment**, click **Fonts and Colors**, and then select fonts and colors for items to be displayed in the Editor and fonts and colors that take effect when printing. Because these settings can differ, the output might differ from what you see displayed in the Editor.  
  
 If you have line numbers enabled in the Editor, the line numbers will not print unless you select **Include line numbers** in the **Print** dialog box on the **File** menu.
