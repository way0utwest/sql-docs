# Database Engine Scripting
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-asdb-asdw-pdw-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-asdb-asdw-pdw-md.md)]
  The [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)] supports the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] PowerShell scripting environment to manage instances of the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] and the objects in the instances. You can also build and run [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] queries that contain [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] and XQuery in environments very similar to scripting environments.  
  
## SQL Server PowerShell  
 [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] includes two [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] PowerShell snap-ins that implement:  
  
-   A [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] PowerShell provider that exposes the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] management object model hierarchies as PowerShell paths that are similar to file system paths. You can use the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] management object model classes to manage the objects represented at each node of the path.  
  
-   A set of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] cmdlets that implement [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] commands. One of the cmdlets is **Invoke-Sqlcmd**. This is used to run [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] Query scripts to be run with the **sqlcmd** utility.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] provides these features for running PowerShell:  
  
-   The **sqlps** PowerShell module that can be imported to a PowerShell session, the module then loads the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] snap-ins. You can interactively run ad hoc PowerShell commands. You can run script files using a command such as .\MyFolder\MyScript.ps1.  
  
-   PowerShell script files can be used as input to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent PowerShell job steps that run the scripts either at scheduled intervals or in response to system events.  
  
-   The **sqlps** utility that starts PowerShell and imports the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] module. You can then perform all actions supported by the module. You can start the **sqlps** utility either in a command prompt or by right-clicking on the nodes in the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Management Studio Object Explorer tree and selecting **Start PowerShell**.  
  
## Database Engine Queries  
 [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] query scripts contain three types of elements:  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] language statements.  
  
-   XQuery language statements  
  
-   Commands and variables from the **sqlcmd** utility.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] provides three environments for building and running [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] queries:  
  
-   You can interactively run and debug [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] queries in the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] Query Editor in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)]. You can code and debug several statements in one session, then save all of the statements in a single script file.  
  
-   The **sqlcmd** command prompt utility lets you interactively run [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] queries, and also run existing [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] query script files.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] query script files are typically coded interactively in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] by using the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] Query Editor. The file can later be opened in one of these environments:  
  
-   Use the [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] **File**/**Open** menu to open the file in a new [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] Query Editor window.  
  
-   Use the **-i***input_file* parameter to run the file with the **sqlcmd** utility.  
  
-   Use the **-QueryFromFile** parameter to run the file with the **Invoke-Sqlcmd** cmdlet in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] PowerShell scripts.  
  
-   Use [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] job steps to run the scripts either at scheduled intervals or in response to system events.  
  
 In addition, you can use the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Generate Script Wizard to generate [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] scripts. You can right-click objects in the [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] Object Explorer, then select the **Generate Script** menu item. **Generate Script** launches the wizard, which guides you through the process of creating a script.
