# Keep the Affinity Mask Default Value
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]
  This rule checks whether the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] setting for the affinity mask is set to 0, which is the default value. The affinity mask option dynamically controls CPU affinity.
