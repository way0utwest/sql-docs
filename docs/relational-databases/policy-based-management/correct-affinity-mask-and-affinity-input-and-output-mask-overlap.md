# Correct Affinity Mask and Affinity Input and Output Mask Overlap
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]
  This rule checks whether the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] has one or more processors that are assigned to be used with both the affinity mask and the affinity I/O mask options. On a computer that has more than one processor, the affinity mask and the affinity I/O mask options are used to designate which CPUs are used by [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. Enabling a CPU with both the affinity mask and the affinity I/O mask can slow performance by forcing the processor to be overused.  
  
## Best Practices Recommendations  
 When you specify either the affinity mask or the affinity I/O mask options, you should specify both, but only enable each CPU no more than once.  
  
 Do not enable the same CPU in both the affinity mask option and the affinity I/O mask option. The bits that correspond to each CPU should be in one of the following states:  
  
-   0 in both the affinity mask option and the affinity I/O mask option  
  
-   0 in the affinity mask option and 1 in the affinity I/O mask option  
  
-   1 in the affinity mask option and 0 in the affinity I/O mask option
