# Use Database Mail Instead of SQL Mail
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]
  This rule checks the sys.configurations catalog view to determine whether the SQL Mail XPs server-wide configuration option is set to ON.  
  
## Best Practices Recommendations  
 SQL Mail will be removed in a future version of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. Avoid using this feature in new development work, and plan to modify applications that currently use this feature. To send mail, use Database Mail.  
  
 SQL Mail runs in-process to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] service. If SQL Mail goes down, so does the server. Database Mail runs outside [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] in a separate process, is scalable, and does not require Extended MAPI client components to be installed on the production server.
