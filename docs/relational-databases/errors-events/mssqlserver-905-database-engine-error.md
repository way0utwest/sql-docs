# MSSQLSERVER_905
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]
  
## Details  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|Product Name|SQL Server|  
|Event ID|905|  
|Event Source|MSSQLSERVER|  
|Component|SQLEngine|  
|Symbolic Name|DBSTARTUP_EE_PARTITIONING|  
|Message Text|Database '%.*ls' cannot be started in this edition of SQL Server because it contains a partition function '%.\*ls'. Only Enterprise edition of SQL Server supports partitioning.|  
  
## Explanation  
The database contains one or more partitioned tables or indexes. This edition of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] cannot use partitioning. Therefore, the database cannot be started correctly. Partitioned tables and indexes are not available in every edition of [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. For a list of features that are supported by the editions of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], see [Features Supported by the Editions of SQL Server 2016](~/sql-server/editions-and-supported-features-for-sql-server-2016.md).  
  
## User Action  
Detach the database by using the sp_detach_db stored procedure. Move the files if it is needed, and then attach the database to an instance of a supported [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] edition by using the CREATE DATABASE with the FOR ATTACH or FOR ATTACH_REBUILD_LOG option. Disable partitioning on all tables and remove the partitioning functions. Detach the database again, and reattach the database to the current server.
