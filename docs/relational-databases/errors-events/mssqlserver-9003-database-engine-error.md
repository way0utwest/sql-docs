|Event ID|9003|  
|Event Source|MSSQLSERVER|  
|Component|SQLEngine|  
|Symbolic Name|LOG_INVALID_LSN|  
|Message Text|The log scan number %S_LSN passed to log scan in database '%.*ls' is not valid. This error may indicate data corruption or that the log file (.ldf) does not match the data file (.mdf). If this error occurred during replication, re-create the publication. Otherwise, restore from backup if the problem results in a failure during startup.|  
  
## Explanation  
A component passed an invalid log sequence number to the log manager for the database. This could be replication, corruption, or an inconsistency between the primary data file and the log.  
  
## User Action  
If this occurred during replication, recreate the publication. Otherwise, restore from backup.
