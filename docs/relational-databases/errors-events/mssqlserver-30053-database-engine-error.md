# MSSQLSERVER_30053

## Details  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|Product Name|SQL Server|  
|Event ID|30053|  
|Event Source|MSSQLSERVER|  
|Component|SQLEngine|  
|Symbolic Name|FTXT_QUERY_E_WORDBREAKINGTIMEOUT|  
|Message Text|Word breaking timed out for the full-text query string. This can happen if the wordbreaker took a long time to process the full-text query string, or if a large number of queries are running on the server. Try running the query again under a lighter load.|  
  
## Explanation  
A word-breaking timeout error can occur in the following situations:  
  
-   The word breaker for the query language is configured incorrectly; for example, its registry settings are incorrect.  
  
-   The word breaker malfunctions for a specific query string.  
  
-   The word breaker returns too much data for a specific query string. Excess data is treated as a potential buffer overrun attack, and shuts down the filter daemon process (fdhost.exe), which hosts the word-breaking services.  
  
-   The filter daemon process configuration is incorrect.  
  
    The most common configuration problems are password expiration or a domain policy that prevents the filter daemon account from logging on.  
  
-   A very heavy query workload is running on the server instance; for example, the word-breaker took a long time to process the full-text query string, or a large number of queries are running on the server. Note that this is the least likely cause.  
  
## User Action  
Select the user action that is appropriate to the probable cause of the timeout, as follows:  
  
|Probable cause|User action|  
|------------------|---------------|  
|The word breaker for the query language is configured incorrectly.|If you are using a third-party word breaker it might be incorrectly registered with the operating system. In this case, re-register the word breaker. For more information, see [Revert the Word Breakers Used by Search to the Previous Version](~/relational-databases/search/revert-the-word-breakers-used-by-search-to-the-previous-version.md).|  
|The word breaker malfunctions for a specific query string.|If the word breaker is supported by [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], contact Microsoft Customer Service and Support.|  
|The word breaker returns too much data for a specific query string.|If the word breaker is supported by [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], contact Microsoft Customer Service and Support.|  
|The filter daemon process configuration is incorrect.|Ensure that you are using the current password and that a domain policy is not preventing the filter daemon account from logging on.|  
|A very heavy query workload is running on the server instance.|Try running the query again under a lighter load.|
