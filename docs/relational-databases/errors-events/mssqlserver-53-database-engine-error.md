# MSSQLSERVER_53
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]
  
## Details  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|Product Name|SQL Server|  
|Event ID|53|  
|Event Source|MSSQLSERVER|  
|Component|SQLEngine|  
|Symbolic Name||  
|Message Text|An error has occurred while establishing a connection to the server.  When connecting to SQL Server, this failure may be caused by the fact that under the default settings SQL Server does not allow remote connections. (provider: Named Pipes Provider, error: 40 - Could not open a connection to SQL Server) (.Net SqlClient Data Provider)|  
  
## Explanation  
The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] client cannot connect to the server. This error could occur because either the client cannot resolve the name of the server or the name of the server is incorrect.  
  
## User Action  
Make sure that you have entered the correct server name on the client, and that you can resolve the name of the server from the client. To check TCP/IP name resolution, you can use the **ping** command in the Windows operating system.
