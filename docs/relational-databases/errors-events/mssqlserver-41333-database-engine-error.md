|Event Source|MSSQLSERVER|  
|Component|SQLEngine|  
|Symbolic Name|CROSS_CONTAINER_ISOLATION_FAILURE|  
|Message Text|The following transactions must access memory optimized tables and natively compiled stored procedures under snapshot isolation: RepeatableRead transactions, Serializable transactions, and transactions that access tables that are not memory optimized in RepeatableRead or Serializable isolation.|  
  
## Explanation  
There are restrictions against the user of the higher isolation levels between disk based transactions and XTP transactions.  
  
## User Action  
Don't attempt high level isolation operations on memory-optimized tables (and natively compiled procedures) and disk based tables.
