## Details  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|Product Name|SQL Server|  
|Event ID|8443|  
|Event Source|MSSQLSERVER|  
|Component|SQLEngine|  
|Symbolic Name|SB_DIALOG_WO_CONV_GROUP|  
|Message Text|The conversation with ID '%.*ls' and initiator %d references a missing conversation group '%.\*ls'. Run DBCC CHECKDB to analyze and repair the database.|  
  
## Explanation  
The metadata layer returned NULL for the conversation group. The database has been corrupted in some way. One possible source of corruption is a disk error.  
  
## User Action  
Run DBCC CHECKDB in repair mode to bring the database back into a consistent state. It may delete messages if necessary to restore consistency. Investigate system error logs to see if this error was caused by another failure in the system.
