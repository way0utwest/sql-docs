|||  
|-|-|  
|Product Name|SQL Server|  
|Event ID|233|  
|Event Source|MSSQLSERVER|  
|Component|SQLEngine|

|Message Text|A connection was successfully established with the server, but then an error occurred during the login process. (provider: Shared Memory Provider, error: 0 - No process is on the other end of the pipe.) (Microsoft SQL Server, Error: 233)|  
  
## Explanation  
The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] client cannot connect to the server. This error could occur because the server is not configured to accept remote connections.  
  
## User Action  
Use the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Configuration Manager tool to allow [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] to accept remote connections.
