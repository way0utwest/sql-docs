# ClientNetworkProtocol Class
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md](../../../includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]
  The [ClientNetworkProtocol Class](../../../relational-databases/wmi-provider-configuration-classes/clientnetworkprotocol-class/clientnetworkprotocol-class.md) represents network protocols installed on a client instance that allows communication with an instance of [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] over a network.  
  
 With the [ClientNetworkProtocol Class](../../../relational-databases/wmi-provider-configuration-classes/clientnetworkprotocol-class/clientnetworkprotocol-class.md), you can perform the following tasks:  
  
-   Set an index value to select a client network protocol from the list of protocols.  
  
-   Check the name, version, .dll file, number of properties, and display name of the referenced client network protocol.  
  
-   Reference the properties of the network protocol.  
  
-   Modify the order in which the protocols are listed and applied.
