# SQL Server XTP Transactions
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  The SQL Server XTP Transactions performance object contains counters related to transactions involving In-Memory OLTP in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
 This table describes the **SQL Server XTP Transactions** counters.  
  
|Counter|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|**Cascading aborts/sec**|The number of transactions that rolled back to due a commit dependency rollback (on average), per second.|  
|**Commit dependencies taken/sec**|The number of commit dependencies taken by transactions (on average), per second.|  
|**Read-only transactions prepared/sec**|The number of read-only transactions that were prepared for commit processing, per second.|  
|**Save point refreshes/sec**|The number of times a savepoint was "refreshed", (on average), per second. A savepoint refresh is when an existing savepoint is reset to the current point in the transaction's lifetime.|  
|**Save point rollbacks/sec**|The number of times a transaction rolled back to a save point (on average), per second.|  
|**Save points created /sec**|The number of save points created (on average), per second.|  
|**Transaction validation failure/sec**|The number of transactions that failed validation processing (on average), per second.|  
|**Transactions aborted by user/sec**|The number of transactions that were aborted by the user (on average), per second.|  
|**Transactions aborted/sec**|The number of transactions that aborted (both by the user and the system, on average), per second.|  
|**Transactions created/sec**|The number of transactions created in the system (on average), per second.<br /><br /> XTP transactions are counted differently than disk-based transactions (as reflected in Databases:Transactions/sec). For example, Transactions created/sec counts read/only transactions, while Databases:Transactions/sec does not.|
