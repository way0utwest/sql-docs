# Date and Time Improvements (OLE DB)
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-asdb-asdw-pdw-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-asdb-asdw-pdw-md.md)]
[!INCLUDE[SNAC_Deprecated](../../includes/snac-deprecated.md)]

  [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../includes/sskatmai-md.md)] introduces new date and time data types. This section describes how these new types are exposed as extensions in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client. For an overview of the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client support for the new date and time data types, see [Date and Time Improvements](../../relational-databases/native-client/features/date-and-time-improvements.md). For a sample, see [Use Enhanced Date and Time Features &#40;OLE DB&#41;](../../relational-databases/native-client-ole-db-how-to/use-enhanced-date-and-time-features-ole-db.md).  
  
 For more general information about date and time data types, see [datetime &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/data-types/datetime-transact-sql.md).  
  
## In This Section  
 [Data Type Support for OLE DB Date and Time Improvements](../../relational-databases/native-client-ole-db-date-time/data-type-support-for-ole-db-date-and-time-improvements.md)  
 Provides information about OLE DB ([!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client) types that support [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] date and time data types.  
  
 [Metadata &#40;OLE DB&#41;](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/605e3be5-aeea-4573-9847-b866ed3c8bff)  
 Contains information about the DBBINDING structure, **ICommandWithParameters::GetParameterInfo**, **ICommandWithParameters::SetParameterInfo**, **IColumnsRowset::GetColumnsRowset**, and I**ColumnsInfo::GetColumnInfo**. Also provides information about updates to OLE DB schema rowsets.  
  
 [Bindings and Conversions &#40;OLE DB&#41;](../../relational-databases/native-client-ole-db-date-time/conversions-ole-db.md)  
 Describes the rules for conversion between server and client for both existing and new date types.  
  
 [Bulk Copy Changes for Enhanced Date and Time Types &#40;OLE DB and ODBC&#41;](../../relational-databases/native-client-odbc-date-time/bulk-copy-changes-for-enhanced-date-and-time-types-ole-db-and-odbc.md)  
 Describes date/time enhancements to support bulk copy operations.  
  
 [OLE DB API Support for Date and Time Enhancements](../../relational-databases/native-client-ole-db-date-time/ole-db-api-support-for-date-and-time-enhancements.md)  
 Describes the OLE DB APIs that support enhanced date/time features.  
  
 [Comparability for IRowsetFind](../../relational-databases/native-client-ole-db-date-time/comparability-for-irowsetfind.md)  
 Describes date/time types and **IRowsetFind**.  
  
 [New Date and Time Features with Previous SQL Server Versions &#40;OLE DB&#41;](../../relational-databases/native-client-ole-db-date-time/new-date-and-time-features-with-previous-sql-server-versions-ole-db.md)  
 Describes the expected behavior when a client application that uses enhanced date and time features communicates with an older version of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], and when a client compiled with an older version of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client sends commands to a server that supports enhanced date and time features.
