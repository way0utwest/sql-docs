# DeleteRecord Method (ADO)
Deletes an entity represented by a [Record](../../../ado/reference/ado-api/record-object-ado.md).  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
Record.DeleteRecord Source, Async  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 *Source*  
 Optional. A **String** value that contains a URL identifying the entity (for example, the file or directory) to be deleted. If *Source* is omitted or specifies an empty string, the entity represented by the current [Record](../../../ado/reference/ado-api/record-object-ado.md) is deleted. If the Record is a collection record ([RecordType](../../../ado/reference/ado-api/recordtype-property-ado.md) of **adCollectionRecord**, such as a directory) all children (for example, subdirectories) will also be deleted.  
  
 *Async*  
 Optional. A **Boolean** value that, when **True**, specifies that the delete operation is asychronous.  
  
## Remarks  
 Operations on the object represented by this **Record** may fail after this method completes. After calling **DeleteRecord**, the **Record** should be closed because the behavior of the **Record** may become unpredictable depending upon when the provider updates the **Record** with the data source.  
  
 If this **Record** was obtained from a [Recordset](../../../ado/reference/ado-api/recordset-object-ado.md), then the results of this operation will not be reflected immediately in the **Recordset**. Refresh the **Recordset** by closing and re-opening it, or by executing the **Recordset** [Requery](../../../ado/reference/ado-api/requery-method.md) method, the [Update](../../../ado/reference/ado-api/update-method.md) method, or the [Resync](../../../ado/reference/ado-api/resync-method.md) method.
