# Stream Object (ADO)
Represents a stream of binary data or text.  
  
 In tree-structured hierarchies such as a file system or an e-mail system, a [Record](../../../ado/reference/ado-api/record-object-ado.md) may have a default binary stream of bits associated with it that contains the contents of the file or the e-mail. A **Stream** object can be used to manipulate fields or records containing these streams of data. A **Stream** object can be obtained in these ways:  
  
-   From a URL pointing to an object (typically a file) containing binary or text data. This object can be a simple document, a **Record** object representing a structured document, or a folder.  
  
-   By opening the default **Stream** object associated with a **Record** object. You can obtain the default stream associated with a **Record** object when the **Record** is opened, to eliminate a round-trip just to open the stream.  
  
-   By instantiating a **Stream** object. These **Stream** objects can be used to store data for the purposes of your application. Unlike a **Stream** associated with a URL, or the default **Stream** of a **Record**, an instantiated **Stream** has no association with an underlying source by default.  
  
 With the methods and properties of a **Stream** object, you can do the following:  
  
-   Open a **Stream** object from a **Record** or URL with the [Open](../../../ado/reference/ado-api/open-method-ado-stream.md) method.  
  
-   Close a **Stream** with the [Close](../../../ado/reference/ado-api/close-method-ado.md) method.  
  
-   Input bytes or text to a **Stream** with the [Write](../../../ado/reference/ado-api/write-method.md) and [WriteText](../../../ado/reference/ado-api/writetext-method.md) methods.  
  
-   Read bytes from the **Stream** with the [Read](../../../ado/reference/ado-api/read-method.md) and [ReadText](../../../ado/reference/ado-api/readtext-method.md) methods.  
  
-   Write any **Stream** data still in the ADO buffer to the underlying object with the [Flush](../../../ado/reference/ado-api/flush-method-ado.md) method.  
  
-   Copy the contents of a **Stream** to another **Stream** with the [CopyTo](../../../ado/reference/ado-api/copyto-method-ado.md) method.  
  
-   Control how lines are read from the source file with the [SkipLine](../../../ado/reference/ado-api/skipline-method.md)method and the [LineSeparator](../../../ado/reference/ado-api/lineseparator-property-ado.md) property.  
  
-   Determine the end of stream position with the [EOS](../../../ado/reference/ado-api/eos-property.md)property and [SetEOS](../../../ado/reference/ado-api/seteos-method.md) method.  
  
-   Save and restore data in files with the [SaveToFile](../../../ado/reference/ado-api/savetofile-method.md)and [LoadFromFile](../../../ado/reference/ado-api/loadfromfile-method-ado.md) methods.  
  
-   Specify the character set used for storing the **Stream** with the [Charset](../../../ado/reference/ado-api/charset-property-ado.md) property.  
  
-   Halt an asynchronous **Stream** operation with the [Cancel](../../../ado/reference/ado-api/cancel-method-ado.md) method.  
  
-   Determine the number of bytes in a **Stream** with the [Size](../../../ado/reference/ado-api/size-property-ado-stream.md) property.  
  
-   Control the current position within a **Stream** with the [Position](../../../ado/reference/ado-api/position-property-ado.md) property.  
  
-   Determine the type of data in a **Stream** with the [Type](../../../ado/reference/ado-api/type-property-ado-stream.md) property.  
  
-   Determine the current state of the **Stream** (closed, open, or executing) with the [State](../../../ado/reference/ado-api/state-property-ado.md) property.  
  
-   Specify the access mode for the **Stream** with the [Mode](../../../ado/reference/ado-api/mode-property-ado.md) property.
