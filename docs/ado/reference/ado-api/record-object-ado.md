# Record Object (ADO)
Represents a row from a [Recordset](../../../ado/reference/ado-api/recordset-object-ado.md) or the data provider, or an object returned by a semi-structured data provider, such as a file or directory.  
  
## Remarks  
 A **Record** object represents one row of data, and has some conceptual similarities with a one-row **Recordset**. Depending on the capabilities of your provider, **Record** objects may be returned directly from your provider instead of a one-row **Recordset**, for example when an SQL query that selects only one row is executed. Or, a **Record** object can be obtained directly from a **Recordset** object. Or, a **Record** can be returned directly from a provider to semi-structured data, such as the Microsoft Exchange OLE DB provider.  
  
 You can view the fields associated with the **Record** object by way of the [Fields](../../../ado/reference/ado-api/fields-collection-ado.md) collection on the **Record** object. ADO allows object-valued columns including **Recordset**, **SafeArray**, and scalar values in the **Fields** collection of **Record** objects.  
  
 If the **Record** object represents a row in a **Recordset**, it is possible to return to that original **Recordset** with the [Source](../../../ado/reference/ado-api/source-property-ado-record.md) property.  
  
 The **Record** object can also be used by semi-structured data providers such as the [Microsoft OLE DB Provider for Internet Publishing](../../../ado/guide/appendixes/microsoft-ole-db-provider-for-internet-publishing.md), to model tree-structured namespaces. Each node in the tree is a **Record** object with associated columns. The columns can represent the attributes of that node and other relevant information. The **Record** object can represent both a leaf node and a non-leaf node in the tree structure. Non-leaf nodes have other nodes as their contents, but leaf nodes do not have such contents. Leaf nodes typically contain binary streams of data and non-leaf nodes may also have a default binary stream associated with them. Properties on the **Record** object identify the type of node.  
  
 The **Record** object also represents an alternative way for navigating hierarchically organized data. A **Record** object may be created to represent the root of a specific sub-tree in a large tree structure and new **Record** objects may be opened to represent child nodes.  
  
 A resource (for example, a file or directory) can be uniquely identified by an absolute URL. A [Connection](../../../ado/reference/ado-api/connection-object-ado.md) object is implicitly created and set to the **Record** object when the **Record** is opened by using an absolute URL. A **Connection** object may explicitly be set to the **Record** object via the [ActiveConnection](../../../ado/reference/ado-api/activeconnection-property-ado.md) property. The files and directories that can be accessed by using the **Connection** object define the *context* in which **Record** operations may occur.  
  
 Data modification and navigation methods on the **Record** object also accept a relative URL, which locates a resource using an absolute URL or the **Connection** object context as a starting point.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  URLs using the http scheme will automatically invoke the [Microsoft OLE DB Provider for Internet Publishing](../../../ado/guide/appendixes/microsoft-ole-db-provider-for-internet-publishing.md). For more information, see [Absolute and Relative URLs](../../../ado/guide/data/absolute-and-relative-urls.md).  
  
 A **Connection** object is associated with each **Record** object. Therefore, **Record** object operations can be part of a transaction by invoking **Connection** object transaction methods.  
  
 The **Record** object does not support ADO events, and therefore will not respond to notifications.  
  
 With the methods and properties of a **Record** object, you can do the following:  
  
-   Set or return the associated **Connection** object with the [ActiveConnection](../../../ado/reference/ado-api/activeconnection-property-ado.md) property.  
  
-   Indicate access permissions with the [Mode](../../../ado/reference/ado-api/mode-property-ado.md) property.  
  
-   Return the URL of the directory, if any, that contains the resource represented by the **Record** with the [ParentURL](../../../ado/reference/ado-api/parenturl-property-ado.md) property.  
  
-   Indicate the absolute URL, relative URL, or **Recordset** from which the **Record** is derived with the [Source](../../../ado/reference/ado-api/source-property-ado-record.md) property.  
  
-   Indicate the current status of the **Record** with the [State](../../../ado/reference/ado-api/state-property-ado.md) property.  
  
-   Indicate the type of **Record** — *simple*, *collection*, or *structured document* — with the [RecordType](../../../ado/reference/ado-api/recordtype-property-ado.md)property.  
  
-   Stop execution of an asynchronous operation with the [Cancel](../../../ado/reference/ado-api/cancel-method-ado.md) method.  
  
-   Disassociate the **Record** from a data source with the [Close](../../../ado/reference/ado-api/close-method-ado.md) method.  
  
-   Copy the file or directory represented by a **Record** to another location with the [CopyRecord](../../../ado/reference/ado-api/copyrecord-method-ado.md) method.  
  
-   Delete the file, or directory and subdirectories, represented by a **Record** with the [DeleteRecord](../../../ado/reference/ado-api/deleterecord-method-ado.md) method.  
  
-   Open a **Recordset** that contains rows that represent the subdirectories and files of the entity represented by the **Record** with the [GetChildren](../../../ado/reference/ado-api/getchildren-method-ado.md) method.  
  
-   Move (rename) the file, or directory and subdirectories, represented by a **Record** to another location with the [MoveRecord](../../../ado/reference/ado-api/moverecord-method-ado.md) method.  
  
-   Associate the **Record** with an existing data source, or create a new file or directory with the [Open](../../../ado/reference/ado-api/open-method-ado-record.md) method.  
  
 The **Record** object is safe for scripting.
