# CompareBookmarks Method (ADO)
Compares two bookmarks and returns an indication of their relative values.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
result = recordset.CompareBookmarks(Bookmark1, Bookmark2)  
```  
  
## Return Value  
 Returns a [CompareEnum](../../../ado/reference/ado-api/compareenum.md) value that indicates the relative row position of two records represented by their bookmarks.  
  
#### Parameters  
 *Bookmark1*  
 The bookmark of the first row.  
  
 *Bookmark2*  
 The bookmark of the second row.  
  
## Remarks  
 The bookmarks must apply to the same [Recordset](../../../ado/reference/ado-api/recordset-object-ado.md) object, or a **Recordset** object and its [clone](../../../ado/reference/ado-api/clone-method-ado.md). You cannot reliably compare bookmarks from different **Recordset** objects, even if they were created from the same source or command. Nor can you compare bookmarks for a **Recordset** object whose underlying provider does not support comparisons.  
  
 A bookmark uniquely identifies a row in a **Recordset** object. Use the [Bookmark](../../../ado/reference/ado-api/bookmark-property-ado.md) property of the current row to obtain its bookmark.  
  
 Because the data type of a bookmark is specific to each provider, ADO exposes it as a **Variant**. For example, SQL Server bookmarks are of type DBTYPE_R8 (**Double**). ADO would expose this type as a **Variant** with a subtype of **Double**.  
  
 When comparing bookmarks, ADO does not attempt any type of coercion. The values are simply passed to the provider where the comparison occurs. If the bookmarks passed to the **CompareBookmarks** method are stored in variables of differing types, it can generate the following type mismatch error: "Arguments are of the wrong type, are out of the acceptable range, or are in conflict with each other."  
  
 A bookmark that is not valid or incorrectly formed will cause an error.
