# Query Method (RDS)
Uses a valid SQL query string to return a [Recordset](../../../ado/reference/ado-api/recordset-object-ado.md).  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Beginning with Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012, RDS server components are no longer included in the Windows operating system (see Windows 8 and [Windows Server 2012 Compatibility Cookbook](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=27416) for more detail). RDS client components will be removed in a future version of Windows. Avoid using this feature in new development work, and plan to modify applications that currently use this feature. Applications that use RDS should migrate to [WCF Data Service](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=199565).  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
Set Recordset = DataFactory.Query(Connection, Query)  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 *Recordset*  
 An object variable that represents a **Recordset** object.  
  
 *DataFactory*  
 An object variable that represents an [RDSServer.DataFactory](../../../ado/reference/rds-api/datafactory-object-rdsserver.md) object.  
  
 *Connection*  
 A **String** value that contains the server connection information. This is similar to the [Connect](../../../ado/reference/rds-api/connect-property-rds.md) property.  
  
 *Query*  
 A **String** that contains the SQL query.  
  
## Remarks  
 The query should use the SQL dialect of the database server. A result status is returned if there is an error with the query that was executed. The **Query** method does not perform any syntax checking on the **Query** string.  
  
## Applies To  
 [DataFactory Object (RDSServer)](../../../ado/reference/rds-api/datafactory-object-rdsserver.md)
