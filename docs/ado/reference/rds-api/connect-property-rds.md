# Connect Property (RDS)
Indicates the database name from which the query and update operations are run.  
  
 You can set the **Connect** property at design time in the [RDS.DataControl](../../../ado/reference/rds-api/datacontrol-object-rds.md) object's OBJECT tags, or at run time in scripting code (for instance, VBScript).  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Beginning with Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012, RDS server components are no longer included in the Windows operating system (see Windows 8 and [Windows Server 2012 Compatibility Cookbook](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=27416) for more detail). RDS client components will be removed in a future version of Windows. Avoid using this feature in new development work, and plan to modify applications that currently use this feature. Applications that use RDS should migrate to [WCF Data Service](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=199565).  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
Design time: <PARAM NAME="Connect" VALUE="ConnectionString">  
Run time: DataControl.Connect = "ConnectionString"  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 *ConnectionString*  
 A valid connection string. For more general information about connection strings, see the [ConnectionString](../../../ado/reference/ado-api/connectionstring-property-ado.md) property or your provider documentation.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Specifying MS Remote as the provider for the **RDS.DataControl** would create a four-tier scenario. Scenarios greater than three tiers have not been tested and should not be needed.  
  
 *DataControl*  
 An object variable that represents an **RDS.DataControl** object.  
  
## Applies To
