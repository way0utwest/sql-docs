# Visual C++ Extensions
The preferred method of programming ADO with Visual C++ is using the **#import** directive, as discussed in [Microsoft Visual C++ ADO Programming](../../../ado/guide/appendixes/visual-c-ado-programming.md). However, earlier versions of ADO shipped with an alternate method of programming using Visual C++: the Visual C++ Extensions. This section documents this feature for those who must maintain Visual C++ Extensions code, but new ADO code should be written using #**import**.

 One of the most tedious jobs Visual C++ programmers face when retrieving data with ADO is converting data returned as a VARIANT data type into a C++ data type, and then storing the converted data in a class or structure. In addition to being cumbersome, retrieving C++ data through a VARIANT data type diminishes performance.

 ADO provides an interface that supports retrieving data into native C/C++ data types without going through a VARIANT, and also provides preprocessor macros that simplify using the interface. The result is a flexible tool that is easier to use and has great performance.

 A common C/C++ client scenario is to bind a record in a [Recordset](../../../ado/reference/ado-api/recordset-object-ado.md) to a C/C++ struct or class containing native C/C++ types. When going through VARIANTs, this involves writing conversion code from VARIANT to C/C++ native types. The Visual C++ Extensions for ADO are targeted at making this scenario much easier for the Visual C++ programmer.

 See the following topics to learn more about the Visual C++ Extensions for ADO.
