# Remote Data Service (RDS)
Remote Data Service (RDS) is a feature of ADO, with which you can move data from a server to a client application or Web page, manipulate the data on the client, and return updates to the server in a single round trip.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Beginning with Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012, RDS server components are no longer included in the Windows operating system (see Windows 8 and [Windows Server 2012 Compatibility Cookbook](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=27416) for more detail). RDS client components will be removed in a future version of Windows. Avoid using this feature in new development work, and plan to modify applications that currently use this feature. Applications that use RDS should migrate to [WCF Data Service](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=199565).  
  
 The RDS Programmer's Guide contains the following chapters:  
  
-   [RDS Fundamentals](../../../ado/guide/remote-data-service/rds-fundamentals.md)  
  
-   [RDS Tutorial](../../../ado/guide/remote-data-service/rds-tutorial.md)  
  
-   [RDS Usage and Security](../../../ado/guide/remote-data-service/rds-usage-and-security.md)
