# Ensuring Sufficient TempDB Space
If errors occur while handling [Recordset](../../../ado/reference/ado-api/recordset-object-ado.md) objects that need processing space on Microsoft SQL Server 6.5, you may need to increase the size of the TempDB. (Some queries require temporary processing space; for example, a query with an ORDER BY clause requires a sort of the **Recordset**, which requires some temporary space.)  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Beginning with Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012, RDS server components are no longer included in the Windows operating system (see Windows 8 and [Windows Server 2012 Compatibility Cookbook](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=27416) for more detail). RDS client components will be removed in a future version of Windows. Avoid using this feature in new development work, and plan to modify applications that currently use this feature. Applications that use RDS should migrate to [WCF Data Service](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=199565).  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Read through this procedure before performing the actions because it isn't as easy to shrink a device once it is expanded.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  By default inMicrosoft SQL Server 7.0 and later, TempDB is set to automatically grow as needed. Therefore, this procedure may only be necessary on servers running versions earlier than 7.0.  
  
### To increase the TempDB space on SQL Server 6.5  
  
1.  Start Microsoft SQL Server Enterprise Manager, open the tree for the Server, and then open the Database Devices tree.  
  
2.  Select a (physical) device to expand, such as Master, and double-click the device to open the **Edit Database Device** dialog box.  
  
     This dialog box shows how much space the current databases are using.  
  
3.  In the **Size** box, increase the device to the desired amount (for example, 50 megabytes (MB) of hard disk space).  
  
4.  Click **Change Now** to increase the amount of space to which the (logical) TempDB can expand.  
  
5.  Open the Databases tree on the server, and then double-click **TempDB** to open the **Edit Database** dialog box. The **Database** tab lists the amount of space currently allocated to TempDB (**Data Size**). By default, this is 2 MB.  
  
6.  Under the **Size** group, click **Expand**. The graphs show the available and allocated space on each of the physical devices. The bars in maroon color represent available space.  
  
7.  Select a **Log Device**, such as Master,to display the available size in the **Size (MB)** box.  
  
8.  Click **Expand Now** to allocate that space to the TempDB database.  
  
     The **Edit Database** dialog box displays the new allocated size for TempDB.
