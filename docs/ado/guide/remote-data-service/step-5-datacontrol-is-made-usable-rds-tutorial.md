# Step 5: DataControl is Made Usable (RDS Tutorial)
The returned **Recordset** object is available for use. You can examine, navigate, or edit it as you would any other **Recordset**. What you can do with the **Recordset** depends on your environment. Visual Basic and Visual C++ have visual controls that can use a **Recordset** directly or indirectly with the aid of an enabling data control.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Beginning with Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012, RDS server components are no longer included in the Windows operating system (see Windows 8 and [Windows Server 2012 Compatibility Cookbook](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=27416) for more detail). RDS client components will be removed in a future version of Windows. Avoid using this feature in new development work, and plan to modify applications that currently use this feature. Applications that use RDS should migrate to [WCF Data Service](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=199565).  
  
 For example, if you are displaying a Web page in Microsoft Internet Explorer, you might want to display the **Recordset** object data in a visual control. Visual controls on a Web page cannot access a **Recordset** object directly. However, they can access the **Recordset** object through the [RDS.DataControl](../../../ado/reference/rds-api/datacontrol-object-rds.md). The **RDS.DataControl** becomes usable by a visual control when its [SourceRecordset](../../../ado/reference/rds-api/recordset-sourcerecordset-properties-rds.md) property is set to the **Recordset** object.  
  
 The visual control object must have its **DATASRC** parameter set to the **RDS.DataControl**, and its **DATAFLD** property set to a **Recordset** object field (column).  
  
 In this tutorial, set the **SourceRecordset** property:  
  
```  
Sub RDSTutorial5()  
   Dim DS as New RDS.DataSpace  
   Dim RS as ADODB.Recordset  
   Dim DC as New RDS.DataControl  
   Dim DF as Object  
   Set DF = DS.CreateObject("RDSServer.DataFactory", "http://yourServer")  
   Set RS = DF.Query ("DSN=Pubs", "SELECT * FROM Authors")  
   DC.SourceRecordset = RS         ' Visual controls can now bind to DC.  
...  
```
