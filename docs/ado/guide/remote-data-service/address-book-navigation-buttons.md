# Address Book Navigation Buttons
The Address Book application displays the navigation buttons at the bottom of the Web page. You can use the navigation buttons to navigate through the data in the HTML grid display by selecting either the first or last row of data, or rows adjacent to the current selection.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Beginning with Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012, RDS server components are no longer included in the Windows operating system (see Windows 8 and [Windows Server 2012 Compatibility Cookbook](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=27416) for more detail). RDS client components will be removed in a future version of Windows. Avoid using this feature in new development work, and plan to modify applications that currently use this feature. Applications that use RDS should migrate to [WCF Data Service](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=199565).  
  
## Navigation Sub Procedures  
 The Address Book application contains several procedures that allow users to click the **First**, **Next**, **Previous**, and **Last** buttons to move around the data.  
  
 For example, clicking the **First** button activates the VBScript First_OnClick Sub procedure. The procedure executes a [MoveFirst](../../../ado/reference/rds-api/movefirst-movelast-movenext-and-moveprevious-methods-rds.md) method, which makes the first row of data the current selection. Clicking the **Last** button activates the Last_OnClick Sub procedure, which invokes the [MoveLast](../../../ado/reference/rds-api/movefirst-movelast-movenext-and-moveprevious-methods-rds.md) method, making the last row of data the current selection. The remaining navigation buttons work in a similar fashion.  
  
```  
' Move to the first record in the bound Recordset.  
Sub First_OnClick  
   DC1.Recordset.MoveFirst  
End Sub  
  
' Move to the next record from the current position   
' in the bound Recordset.  
Sub Next_OnClick  
   If Not DC1.Recordset.EOF Then    ' Cannot move beyond bottom record.  
      DC1.Recordset.MoveNext  
      Exit Sub  
   End If     
End Sub  
  
' Move to the previous record from the current position in the bound   
' Recordset.  
Sub Prev_OnClick  
   If Not DC1.Recordset.BOF Then    ' Cannot move beyond top record.  
      DC1.Recordset.MovePrevious  
      Exit Sub  
   End If  
End Sub  
  
' Move to the last record in the bound Recordset.  
Sub Last_OnClick  
   DC1.Recordset.MoveLast  
End Sub  
```
