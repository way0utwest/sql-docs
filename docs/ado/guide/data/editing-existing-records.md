# Editing Existing Records
To edit existing records, move to the row you want to edit and change the **Value** property of the fields you want to change. For more information about the **Field** object's **Value** property, see [Examining Data](../../../ado/guide/data/examining-data.md). Depending on your cursor type, you will use **Update** or **UpdateBatch** to send changes back to the data source. For more information, see [Updating and Persisting Data](../../../ado/guide/data/updating-and-persisting-data.md).  
  
 It is usually more efficient to use a stored procedure with a command object to perform updates, as well as to perform other operations, because a stored procedure does not require the creation of a cursor. For more information about cursors, see [Understanding Cursors and Locks](../../../ado/guide/data/understanding-cursors-and-locks.md).
