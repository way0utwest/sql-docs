# Recordset Positioning
Use the **AbsolutePosition** property to move to a record, based on its ordinal position in the **Recordset** object, or to determine the ordinal position of the current record. The provider must support the appropriate functionality for this property to be available.  
  
 **AbsolutePosition** is 1-based and equals 1 when the current record is the first record in the **Recordset**. As mentioned previously, you can obtain the total number of records in the **Recordset** object from the **RecordCount** property.  
  
 When you set the **AbsolutePosition** property, even if it is to a record in the current cache, ADO reloads the cache with a new group of records starting with the record you specified. The **CacheSize** property determines the size of this group.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You should not use the **AbsolutePosition** property as a surrogate record number. The position of a given record changes when you delete a preceding record. There also is no assurance that a given record will have the same **AbsolutePosition** if the **Recordset** object is requeried or reopened. Bookmarks are the recommended way of retaining and returning to a given position and are the only way of positioning across all types of **Recordset** objects.
