# Batch Mode
Batch mode is in effect when the **LockType** property is set to **adLockBatchOptimistic** and batch updating is supported by the provider. Certain lock type settings are not available depending on cursor location. For instance, a pessimistic lock type is not available when the **CursorLocation** is set to **adUseClient**. Conversely, a provider cannot support a batch optimistic lock when the cursor location is on the server. You should use batch updating with either a keyset or static cursor only.  
  
 The **UpdateBatch** method is used to send **Recordset** changes held in the copy buffer to the server to update the data source. In the following section, we will open a **Recordset** in batch mode, make changes to the copy buffer, and then send our changes to the data source using a call to **UpdateBatch**.  
  
 This section contains the following topics:  
  
-   [Sending the Updates: UpdateBatch Method](../../../ado/guide/data/sending-the-updates-updatebatch-method.md)  
  
-   [Filtering for Updated Records](../../../ado/guide/data/filtering-for-updated-records.md)  
  
-   [Dealing with Failed Updates](../../../ado/guide/data/dealing-with-failed-updates.md)  
  
-   [Detecting and Resolving Conflicts](../../../ado/guide/data/detecting-and-resolving-conflicts.md)
