# The Fields Collection
The **Fields** collection is one of ADO's intrinsic collections. A collection is an ordered set of items that can be referred to as a unit. For more information about ADO collections, see [The ADO Object Model](../../../ado/guide/data/ado-objects-and-collections.md).  
  
 The **Fields** collection contains a **Field** object for every field (column) in the **Recordset**. Like all ADO collections, it has **Count** and **Item** properties, as well as **Append** and **Refresh** methods. It also has **CancelUpdate**, **Delete**, **Resync**, and **Update** methods, which are not available to other ADO collections.  
  
## Examining the Fields Collection  
 Consider the **Fields** collection of the sample **Recordset** introduced in this section. The sample **Recordset** was derived from the SQL statement  
  
```  
SELECT ProductID, ProductName, UnitPrice FROM Products WHERE CategoryID = 7  
```  
  
 Thus, you should find that the **Recordset Fields** collection contains three fields.  
  
```  
'BeginWalkFields  
    Dim objFields As ADODB.Fields  
    Dim intLoop As Integer  
  
    objRs.Open strSQL, strConnStr, adOpenForwardOnly, adLockReadOnly, adCmdText  
  
    Set objFields = objRs.Fields  
  
    For intLoop = 0 To (objFields.Count - 1)  
        Debug.Print objFields.Item(intLoop).Name  
    Next  
'EndWalkFields  
```  
  
 This code simply determines the number of **Field** objects in the **Fields** collection using the **Count** property and loops through the collection, returning the value of the **Name** property for each **Field** object. You can use many more **Field** properties to get information about a field. For more information about querying a **Field**, see [The Field Object](../../../ado/guide/data/the-field-object.md).  
  
## Counting Columns  
 As you might expect, the **Count** property returns the actual number of **Field** objects in the **Fields** collection. Because numbering for members of a collection begins with zero, you should always code loops starting with the zero member and ending with the value of the **Count** property minus 1. If you are using Microsoft Visual Basic and want to loop through the members of a collection without checking the **Count** property, use the **For Each...Next** command.  
  
 If the **Count** property is zero, there are no objects in the collection.  
  
## Getting to the Field  
 As with any ADO collection, the **Item** property is the default property of the collection. It returns the individual **Field** object specified by the name or index passed to it. Therefore, the following statements are equivalent for the sample **Recordset**:  
  
```  
objField = objRecordset.Fields.Item("ProductID")  
objField = objRecordset.Fields("ProductID")  
objField = objRecordset.Fields.Item(0)  
objField = objRecordset.Fields(0)  
```  
  
 If these methods are equivalent, which is best? It depends. Using an index to retrieve a **Field** from the collection is faster because it accesses the **Field** directly without having to perform a string lookup. On the other hand, the order of **Fields** within the collection must be known, and if the order changes, the reference to the **Field's** index will have to be changed wherever it occurs. Although slightly slower, using the name of the **Field** is more flexible because it doesn't depend on the order of the **Fields** in the collection.  
  
## Using the Refresh Method  
 Unlike some other ADO collections, using the **Refresh** method on the **Fields** collection has no visible effect. To retrieve changes from the underlying database structure, you must use either the **Requery** method, or if the **Recordset** object does not support bookmarks, the **MoveFirst** method, which will cause the command to be executed against the provider again.  
  
## Adding Fields to a Recordset  
 The **Append** method is used to add fields to a **Recordset**.  
  
 You can use the **Append** method to fabricate a **Recordset** programmatically without opening a connection to a data source. A run-time error will occur if the **Append** method is called on the **Fields** collection of an open **Recordset** or on a **Recordset** where the **ActiveConnection** property has been set. You can append fields only to a **Recordset** that is not open and has not yet been connected to a data source. However, to specify values for the newly appended **Fields**, the **Recordset** must first be opened.  
  
 Developers often need a place to temporarily store some data, or want some data to act as if it came from a server so it can participate in data binding in a user interface. ADO (in conjunction with the [Microsoft Cursor Service for OLE DB](../../../ado/guide/appendixes/microsoft-cursor-service-for-ole-db-ado-service-component.md)) enables the developer to build an empty **Recordset** object by specifying column information and calling **Open**. In the following example, three new fields are appended to a new **Recordset** object. Then the **Recordset** is opened, two new records are added, and the **Recordset** is persisted to a file. (For more information about **Recordset** persistence, see [Updating and Persisting Data](../../../ado/guide/data/updating-and-persisting-data.md).)  
  
```  
'BeginFabricate  
    Dim objRs As ADODB.Recordset  
    Set objRs = New ADODB.Recordset  
  
    With objRs.Fields  
        .Append "StudentID", adChar, 11, adFldUpdatable  
        .Append "FullName", adVarChar, 50, adFldUpdatable  
        .Append "PhoneNmbr", adVarChar, 20, adFldUpdatable  
    End With  
  
    With objRs  
        .Open  
  
        .AddNew  
        .Fields(0) = "123-45-6789"  
        .Fields(1) = "John Doe"  
        .Fields(2) = "(425) 555-5555"  
        .Update  
  
        .AddNew  
        .Fields(0) = "123-45-6780"  
        .Fields(1) = "Jane Doe"  
        .Fields(2) = "(615) 555-1212"  
        .Update  
    End With  
  
    objRs.Save App.Path & "FabriTest.adtg", adPersistADTG  
  
    objRs.Close  
'EndFabricate  
```  
  
 The usage of the **Fields Append** method differs between the **Recordset** object and the **Record** object. For more information about the **Record** object, see [Records and Streams](../../../ado/guide/data/records-and-streams.md).
