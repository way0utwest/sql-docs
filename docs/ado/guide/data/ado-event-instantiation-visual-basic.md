# ADO Event Instantiation: Visual Basic
In order to handle ADO events in Microsoft® Visual Basic®, you must declare a module-level variable using the **WithEvents** keyword. The variable can be declared only as part of a class module and must be declared at the module level. This is not as restrictive as it seems, however, because Visual Basic **Form** objects are also classes. The simplest way to handle ADO events is to declare a variable using **WithEvents**. The following example handles the **ConnectComplete** event for a **Connection** object:  
  
```  
' BeginEventExampleVB02  
Dim WithEvents connEvent As Connection  
Attribute connEvent.VB_VarHelpID = -1  
  
Private Sub Form_Load()  
Dim strConn As String  
  
   ' Create a new object with event  
   ' handling enabled.  
   strConn = "Provider=sqloledb;" & _  
      "Data Source=MyServer;" & _  
      "Initial Catalog=Northwind;" & _  
      "Integrated Security=SSPI;"  
   Set connEvent = New ADODB.Connection  
   connEvent.Open strConn  
End Sub  
  
Private Sub connEvent_ConnectComplete(ByVal pError As ADODB.Error, _  
    adStatus As ADODB.EventStatusEnum, _  
    ByVal pConnection As ADODB.Connection)  
Dim strMsg As String  
  
   If adStatus = adStatusErrorsOccurred Then  
      Select Case pError.Number  
         Case adErrOperationCancelled  
            ' The operation was cancelled in the  
            ' Will event. Notify the user and exit.  
            strMsg = "I'm sorry you can't connect right now." & vbCrLf  
            strMsg = strMsg & "Click OK to exit."  
            Unload Me  
         Case Else  
            strMsg = "Error " & Format(pError.Number) & vbCrLf  
            strMsg = strMsg & pError.Description  
            strMsg = strMsg & "Click OK to exit."  
            Unload Me  
      End Select  
   End If  
   frmWait.btnOK.Enabled = True  
End Sub  
' EndEventExampleVB02  
```  
  
 The **Connection** object is declared at the **Form** level using the **WithEvents** keyword to enable event handling. The Form_Load event handler actually creates the object by assigning a new **Connection** object to *connEvent* and then opens the connection. Of course, a real application would do more processing in the Form_Load event handler than is shown here.
