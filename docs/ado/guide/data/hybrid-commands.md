# Hybrid Commands
Hybrid commands are partially parameterized commands. For example:  
  
```  
SHAPE {select * from plants}   
   APPEND( {select * from customers where country = ?}   
           RELATE PlantCountry TO PARAMETER 0,   
             PlantRegion TO CustomerRegion )   
```  
  
 The caching behavior for a hybrid command is the same as that of regular parameterized commands.
