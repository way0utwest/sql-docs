# Records and Streams
ADO currently provides the [Recordset](../../../ado/reference/ado-api/recordset-object-ado.md) object as the primary means of accessing information in data sources, such as relational databases. However, some providers support the [Record](../../../ado/reference/ado-api/record-object-ado.md) and [Stream](../../../ado/reference/ado-api/stream-object-ado.md) objects as alternative or complementary objects with which data from providers can be manipulated. For specifics on **Record** behavior, see your provider's documentation.  
  
## Records  
 **Record** objects essentially function as one-row **Recordset**s. However, **Records** have limited functionality compared to **Recordsets** and they have different properties and methods.The source for the data in a **Record** object can be a command which returns one row of data from the provider. Using **Record** objects rather than **Recordset** objects to receive the results from a query that returns one row of data eliminates the overhead of instantiating the more complex **Recordset** object.  
  
 **Record** objects can serve another purpose, particularly with providers for data sources other than traditional relational databases, such as the [Microsoft OLE DB Provider for Internet Publishing](../../../ado/guide/appendixes/microsoft-ole-db-provider-for-internet-publishing.md). Much of the information that must be processed exists, not as tables in databases, but as messages in electronic mail systems and files in modern file systems. The **Record** and **Stream** objects facilitate access to information stored in sources other than relational databases.  
  
 The **Record** object can represent and manage data such as directories and files in a file system or folders and messages in an e-mail system. For these purposes, the source for the **Record** can be the current row of an open **Recordset**, an absolute URL, or a relative URL in conjunction with an open [Connection](../../../ado/reference/ado-api/connection-object-ado.md) object.  
  
 Typically, a **Recordset** can be used to represent a container or parent in a hierarchy such as a folder or directory. A **Record** can be used to return specific information about one node in the parent container, such as a file or document. The primary reason **Records** are used to represent this type of information is that these sources of data are heterogeneous. This means that each **Record** may have a different set and number of fields. Traditional **Recordsets** containing rows from a database are homogenous, which means that each row has the same number and type of fields.  
  
 For more information about using the **Record** object for processing this heterogeneous data from providers such as the Internet Publishing Provider, see [Using ADO for Internet Publishing](../../../ado/guide/data/using-ado-for-internet-publishing.md).  
  
## Streams  
 The **Stream** object provides the means to read, write, and manage a stream of bytes. This byte stream may be text or binary and is limited in size only by system resources. Typically, ADO **Stream** objects are used for the following purposes:  
  
-   To contain the data of a **Recordset** saved in XML format. These XML streams from saved **Recordset**s can be used as the source when opening a new **Recordset**. For more information, see [Streams and Persistence](../../../ado/guide/data/streams-and-persistence.md).  
  
-   To contain [CommandStreams](../../../ado/reference/ado-api/commandstream-property-ado.md) to be executed against the provider as an alternative to [CommandText](../../../ado/reference/ado-api/commandtext-property-ado.md). For example, XML UpdateGrams can be used as the source for a command against the Microsoft OLE DB Provider for SQL Server.  
  
-   To receive results from the provider in a format other than a **Recordset**, such as XML results from the Microsoft OLE DB Provider for SQL Server. For more information, see [Retrieving Resultsets into Streams](../../../ado/guide/data/retrieving-resultsets-into-streams.md).  
  
-   To contain the text or bytes that comprise a file or message, typically used with providers such as the Microsoft OLE DB Provider for Internet Publishing. For more information about this use of **Stream** objects, see [Using ADO for Internet Publishing](../../../ado/guide/data/using-ado-for-internet-publishing.md).  
  
 A **Stream** object can be opened on:  
  
-   A simple file specified with a URL.  
  
-   A field of a **Record** or **Recordset** containing a **Stream** object.  
  
-   The default stream of a **Record** or **Recordset** object representing a directory or compound file.  
  
-   A resource field containing the URL of a simple file.  
  
-   No particular source at all. In this case, a **Stream** object is opened in memory. Data can be written to it and then saved in another **Stream** or file.  
  
-   A BLOB field in a **Recordset**.
