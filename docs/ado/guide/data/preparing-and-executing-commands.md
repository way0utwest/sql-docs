# Preparing and Executing Commands
Commands are instructions issued to a provider to perform some operations against the underlying data source. An SQL statement, for example, is a command to the Microsoft SQL Data Provider. In ADO, commands are typically represented by **Command** objects, although simple commands can also be issued through **Connection** or **Recordset** objects.  
  
 You can use the **Command** object to request any supported type of operation from the provider, assuming that the provider can interpret the command string properly. A common operation for data providers is to query a database and return records in a **Recordset** object, which that can be thought of as a container to hold the result and a tool to view the result. As with many ADO objects, some **Command** object collections, methods, or properties might generate errors when referenced, depending on the functionality of the provider.  
  
 In addition to using **Command** objects, you can use the **Execute** method on the **Connection** object or the **Open** method on the **Recordset** object to issue a command and have it executed. However, you should use a **Command** object if you need to reuse a command in your code, or if you need to pass detailed parameter information with your command. These scenarios are covered in more detail later in this section.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Certain **Command**s can return a result set as a binary stream or as a single **Record** rather than as a **Recordset**, if this is supported by the provider. Also, some **Command**s are not intended to return any result set at all (for example, a SQL Update query). This section will cover the most typical scenario, however: executing **Command**s that return results as a **Recordset** object. For more information about returning results into **Record**s or **Stream**s, see [Records and Streams](../../../ado/guide/data/records-and-streams.md).
