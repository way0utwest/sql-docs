# Realtime scoring

This topic describes a feature available in SQL Server 2016 and SQL Server 2017 that supports scoring on machine learning models in near realtime.

> [!TIP]
> Native scoring is a special implementation of realtime scoring that uses the native T-SQL PREDICT function for very fast scoring, and is available only in SQL Server 2017. For more information, see [Native scoring](sql-native-scoring.md).

## How realtime scoring works

Realtime scoring is supported in both SQL Server 2017 and SQL Server 2016, on specific model types created by using supproted RevoScaleR or MicrosoftML algorithms. It uses native C++ libraries to generate scores, based on user input provided to a machine learning model stored in a special binary format.

Because a trained model can be used for scoring without having to call an external language runtime, the overhead of multiple processes is reduced. This supports much faster prediction performance for production scoring scenarios. Because the data never leaves SQL Server, results can be generated and inserted into a new table without any data translation between R and SQL.

Realtime scoring is a multi-step process:

1. The stored procedure that does scoring must be enabled on a per-database basis.
2. You load the pre-trained model in binary format.
3. You provide new input data, either tabular or single rows, as input to the model.
4. To generate scores, call the sp_rxPredict stored procedure.

## Get started

For code examples and instructions, see [How to perform native scoring or realtime scoring](r/how-to-do-realtime-scoring.md).

For an example of how rxPredict can used for scoring, see [End to End Loan ChargeOff Prediction Built Using Azure HDInsight Spark Clusters and SQL Server 2016 R Service](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/rserver/2017/06/29/end-to-end-loan-chargeoff-prediction-built-using-azure-hdinsight-spark-clusters-and-sql-server-2016-r-service/)

> [!TIP]
> If you are working exclusively in R code, you can also use the [rxPredict](https://docs.microsoft.com/r-server/r-reference/revoscaler/rxpredict) function for fast scoring.

## Requirements

Realtime scoring is supported on these platforms:

+ SQL Server 2017 Machine Learning Services
+ SQL Server R Services 2016, with an upgrade of the R Services instance to Microsoft R Server 9.1.0 or later
+ Machine Learning Server (Standalone)

On SQL Server, you must enable the realtime scoring feature in advance. This is because the feature requires installation of CLR-based libraries into SQL Server.

For information regarding realtime scoring in a distributed environment based on Microsoft R Server, please refer to the [publishService](https://docs.microsoft.com/machine-learning-server/r-reference/mrsdeploy/publishservice) function available in the [mrsDeploy package](https://docs.microsoft.com/machine-learning-server/r-reference/mrsdeploy/mrsdeploy-package), which supports publishing models for realtime scoring as a new a web service running on R Server.

### Restrictions

+ The model must be trained in advance using one of the supported **rx** algorithms. For details, see [Supported algorithms](#bkmk_rt_supported_algos). Realtime scoring with `sp_rxPredict` supports both RevoScaleR and MicrosoftML algorithms.

+ The model must be saved using the new serialization functions: [rxSerialize](https://docs.microsoft.com/machine-learning-server/r-reference/revoscaler/rxserializemodel) for R, and [rx_serialize_model](https://docs.microsoft.com/machine-learning-server/python-reference/revoscalepy/rx-serialize-model) for Python. These serialization functions have been optimized to support fast scoring.

+ Realtime scoring does not use an interpreter interpreter; therefore, any functionality that might require an interpreter is not supported during the scoring step.  These might include:

  + Models using the `rxGlm` or `rxNaiveBayes` algorithms are not currently supported

  + RevoScaleR models that use an R transformation function, or a formula that contains a transformation, such as <code>A ~ log(B)</code> are not supported in realtime scoring. To use a model of this type, we recommend that you perform the transformation on the to input data before passing the data to realtime scoring.

+ Realtime scoring is currently optimized for fast predictions on smaller data sets, ranging from a few rows to  hundreds of thousand of rows. On very large datasets, using [rxPredict](https://docs.microsoft.com/machine-learning-server/r-reference/revoscaler/rxpredict) might be faster.
