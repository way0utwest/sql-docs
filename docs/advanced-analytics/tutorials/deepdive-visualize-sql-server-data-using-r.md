#  Visualize SQL Server data using R (SQL and R deep dive)

This article is part of the Data Science Deep Dive tutorial, on how to use [RevoScaleR](https://docs.microsoft.com/machine-learning-server/r-reference/revoscaler/revoscaler) with SQL Server.

The enhanced packages in [!INCLUDE[rsql_productname](../../includes/rsql-productname-md.md)] include multiple functions that have been optimized for scalability and parallel processing. Typically these functions are prefixed with **rx** or **Rx**.

For this walkthrough, you use the **rxHistogram** function to view the distribution of values in the _creditLine_ column by gender.

## Visualize data using rxHistogram

1. Use the following R code to call the [rxHistogram](https://docs.microsoft.com/machine-learning-server/r-reference/revoscaler/rxhistogram) function and pass a formula and data source. You can run this locally at first, to see the expected results, and how long it takes.
  
    ```R
    rxHistogram(~creditLine|gender, data = sqlFraudDS,  histType = "Percent")
    ```
 
    Internally, **rxHistogram** calls the [rxCube](https://docs.microsoft.com/machine-learning-server/r-reference/revoscaler/rxcube) function, which is included in the **RevoScaleR** package. **rxCube** outputs a single list (or data frame) containing one column for each variable specified in the formula, plus a counts column.
    
2. Now, set the compute context to the remote SQL Server computer and run **rxHistogram** again.
  
    ```R
    rxSetComputeContext(sqlCompute)
    ```
 
3. The results are exactly the same, since you're using the same data source; however, the computations are performed on the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] computer.  The results are then returned to your local workstation for plotting.

4. You can also call the **rxCube** function and pass the results to an R plotting function.  For example, the following example uses **rxCube** to compute the mean of *fraudRisk* for every combination of *numTrans* and *numIntlTrans*:
  
    ```R
    cube1 <- rxCube(fraudRisk~F(numTrans):F(numIntlTrans),  data = sqlFraudDS)
    ```
  
    To specify the groups used to compute group means, use the `F()` notation. In this example, `F(numTrans):F(numIntlTrans)` indicates that the integers in the variables `_numTrans` and `numIntlTrans` should be treated as categorical variables, with a level for each integer value.
  
    Because the low and high levels were already added to the data source `sqlFraudDS` (using the `colInfo` parameter), the levels are automatically used in the histogram.
  
5. The default return value of **rxCube** is an *rxCube object*, which represents a cross-tabulation. However, you can use the [rxResultsDF](https://docs.microsoft.com/machine-learning-server/r-reference/revoscaler/rxresultsdf) function to convert the results into a data frame that can easily be used in one of Râ€™s standard plotting functions.
  
    ```R
    cubePlot <- rxResultsDF(cube1)
    ```
  
    The **rxCube** function includes an optional argument, *returnDataFrame* = **TRUE**, that you could use to convert the results to a data frame directly. For example:
    
    `print(rxCube(fraudRisk~F(numTrans):F(numIntlTrans), data = sqlFraudDS, returnDataFrame = TRUE))`
       
    However, the output of **rxResultsDF** is much cleaner and preserves the names of the source columns.
  
6. Finally, run the following code to create a heat map using the `levelplot` function from the **lattice** package, which is included with all R distributions.
  
    ```R
    levelplot(fraudRisk~numTrans*numIntlTrans, data = cubePlot)
    ```
  
    **Results**
  
    ![scatterplot results](media/rsql-sue-scatterplotresults.jpg "scatterplot results")
  
From even this quick analysis, you can see that the risk of fraud increases with both the number of transactions and the number of international transactions.
