# Using R functions with SQL Server data (R in SQL quickstart)

Now that you're familiar with basic operations, it's time to have some fun with R. For example, many advanced statistical functions might be complicated to implement using T-SQL, but require only a single line of R code.  With R Services, it's easy to embed R utility scripts in a stored procedure.

In these examples, you'll embed R mathematical and utility functions in a SQL Server stored procedure.

## Create a stored procedure to generate random numbers

For simplicity, let's use the R `stats` package, which is installed and loaded by default with R Services. The package contains hundreds of functions for common statistical tasks, among them the `rnorm` function, which generates a specified number of random numbers using the normal distribution, given a standard deviation and mean.

For example, this R code returns 100 numbers on a mean of 50, given a standard deviation of 3.

```R
as.data.frame(rnorm(100, mean = 50, sd = 3));
```

To call this line of R from T-SQL, run sp_execute_external_script and add the R function in the R script parameter, like this:

```sql
EXEC sp_execute_external_script
      @language = N'R'
    , @script = N'
         OutputDataSet <- as.data.frame(rnorm(100, mean = 50, sd =3));'
    , @input_data_1 = N'   ;'
      WITH RESULT SETS (([Density] float NOT NULL));
```

What if you'd like to make it easier to generate a different set of random numbers?

That's easy when combined with SQL Server: define a stored procedure that gets the arguments from the user. Then, pass those arguments into the R script as variables.

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE MyRNorm (@param1 int, @param2 int, @param3 int)
AS
    EXEC sp_execute_external_script
      @language = N'R'
    , @script = N'
	     OutputDataSet <- as.data.frame(rnorm(mynumbers, mymean, mysd));'
    , @input_data_1 = N'   ;'
	, @params = N' @mynumbers int, @mymean int, @mysd int'
	, @mynumbers = @param1
	, @mymean = @param2
	, @mysd = @param3
    WITH RESULT SETS (([Density] float NOT NULL));
```

+ The first line defines each of the SQL input parameters that are required when the stored procedure is executed.

+ The line beginning with `@params` defines all variables used by the R code, and the corresponding SQL data types.

+ The lines that immediately follow map the SQL parameter names to the corresponding R variable names.

Now that you've wrapped the R function in a stored procedure, you can easily call the function and pass in different values, like this:

```sql
EXEC MyRNorm @param1 = 100,@param2 = 50, @param3 = 3
```

+ To help you convert your standalone R code to a format that can be easily parameterized using SQL Server stored procedures, the Microsoft R team has provided a new R package, **sqlrutils**. For more information, see [How to Create a stored procedure using sqlrutils](../r/how-to-create-a-stored-procedure-using-sqlrutils.md).

## Use R utility functions for troubleshooting

By default, an installation of R includes the `utils` package, which provides a variety of utility functions for investigating the current R environment. This can be useful if you are finding discrepancies in the way your R code performs in SQL Server and in outside environments.

For example, you might use the R `memory.limit()` function to get memory for the current R environment. Because the `utils` package is installed but not loaded by default, you must use the `library()` function to load it first.

```sql
EXECUTE sp_execute_external_script
      @language = N'R'
    , @script = N'
        library(utils);
        mymemory <- memory.limit();
        OutputDataSet <- as.data.frame(mymemory);'
    , @input_data_1 = N' ;'
WITH RESULT SETS (([Col1] int not null));
```

Many users like to use the system timing functions in R, such as `system.time` and `proc.time`,  to capture the time used by R processes and analyze performance issues.

For an example, see this tutorial: [Create Data Features](../tutorials/walkthrough-create-data-features.md). In this walkthrough, R timing functions are embedded in the solution to compare the performance of two methods for creating features from data: R functions vs. T-SQL functions.
