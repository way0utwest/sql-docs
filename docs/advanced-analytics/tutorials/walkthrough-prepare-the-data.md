# Prepare the data using PowerShell (walkthrough)

By this time, you should have one of the following installed:

+ SQL Server 2016 R Services
+ SQL Server 2017 Machine Learning Services, with the R language enabled

In this lesson, you download the data, R packages, and R scripts used in the walkthrough from a Github repository. You can download everything using a PowerShell script for convenience.

You also need to install some additional R packages, both on the server and on your R workstation. The steps are described.

Then, you use a second PowerShell script, RunSQL_R_Walkthrough.ps1, to configure the database that is used for modeling and scoring. That script performs a bulk load of the data into the database you specify, and then creates some SQL functions and stored procedures that simplify data science tasks.

Let's get started!

## 1. Download the data and scripts

All the code needed has been provided in a GitHub repository. You can use a PowerShell script to make a local copy of the files.

1.  On your data science client computer, open a Windows PowerShell command prompt as administrator.

2.  To ensure that you can run the download script without an error, run this command. It  temporarily allows scripts without changing system defaults.

    ```
    Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process -Force
    ```
      
3.  Run the following Powershell command to download script files to a local directory. If you do not specify a different directory, by default the folder `C:\tempR` is created and all files saved there.
  
    ```
    $source = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/Azure-MachineLearning-DataScience/master/Misc/RSQL/Download_Scripts_R_Walkthrough.ps1'  
    $ps1_dest = "$pwd\Download_Scripts_R_Walkthrough.ps1"
    $wc = New-Object System.Net.WebClient
    $wc.DownloadFile($source, $ps1_dest)
    .\Download_Scripts_R_Walkthrough.ps1 –DestDir 'C:\tempR'
    ```
  
    If you want to save the files in a different directory, edit the values of the parameter *DestDir* and specify a different folder on your computer. If you type a folder name that does not exist, the PowerShell script creates the folder for you.
  
4.  Downloading might take a while. After it is complete, the Windows PowerShell command console should look like this:
  
    ![After completion of PowerShell script](media/rsql-e2e-psscriptresults.PNG "After completion of PowerShell script")
  
5.  In the PowerShell console, you can run the command `ls` to view a list of the files that were downloaded to *DestDir*.  For a description of the files, see [What's Included](#What-the-Download-Includes).

## 2. Install required R packages

This walkthrough requires some R libraries that are not installed by default as part of [!INCLUDE[rsql_productname](../../includes/rsql-productname-md.md)]. You must install the packages both on the client where you develop the solution, and on the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] computer where you deploy the solution.

### Install required packages on the client

The R script that you downloaded includes the commands to download and install these packages.

1. In your R environment, open the script file, RSQL_R_Walkthrough.R.

2. Highlight and execute these lines.
    
    ```
    # Install required R libraries, if they are not already installed.
    if (!('ggmap' %in% rownames(installed.packages()))){install.packages('ggmap')}
    if (!('mapproj' %in% rownames(installed.packages()))){install.packages('mapproj')}
    if (!('ROCR' %in% rownames(installed.packages()))){install.packages('ROCR')}
    if (!('RODBC' %in% rownames(installed.packages()))){install.packages('RODBC')}
    ```
    
    Some packages also install required packages. In all, about 32 packages are required.

### Install required packages on the server

There are many different ways that you can install packages on SQL Server. For example, SQL Server provides a [package management](../r/installing-and-managing-r-packages.md) feature that lets database administrators create a package repository and assign user the rights to install their own packages. However, if you are an administrator on the computer, you can install new packages using R, as long as you install to the correct library.

> [!NOTE]
> On the server, **do not** install to a user library even if prompted. If you install to a user library, the SQL Server instance cannot find or run the packages. For more information, see [Installing New R Packages on SQL Server](../r/install-additional-r-packages-on-sql-server.md).

1. On the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] computer, open RGui.exe **as an administrator**.  If you have installed SQL Server R Services using the defaults, RGui.exe can be found in C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL13.MSSQLSERVER\R_SERVICES\bin\x64).

2.  At an R prompt, run the following R commands:
  
    ```
    install.packages("ggmap", lib=grep("Program Files", .libPaths(), value=TRUE)[1])
    install.packages("mapproj", lib=grep("Program Files", .libPaths(), value=TRUE)[1])
    install.packages("ROCR", lib=grep("Program Files", .libPaths(), value=TRUE)[1])
    install.packages("RODBC", lib=grep("Program Files", .libPaths(), value=TRUE)[1])
    ```

    - This example uses the R grep function to search the vector of available paths and find the path that includes “Program Files”. For more information, see [http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/functions/grep](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/functions/grep).

    - If you think the packages are already installed, check the list of installed packages by running `installed.packages()`.

## 3. Prepare the environment using RunSQL_R_Walkthrough.ps1

Along with the data files, R scripts, and T-SQL scripts, the download includes the PowerShell script `RunSQL_R_Walkthrough.ps1`. The script performs these actions:

- Checks whether the SQL Native Client and command-line utilities for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] are installed. The command-line tools are needed to run the [bcp Utility](../../tools/bcp-utility.md), which is used for fast bulk loading of data into SQL tables.

- Connects to the specified instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] and runs some [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] scripts that configure the database and create the tables for the model and data.

- Runs a SQL script to create several stored procedures.

- Loads the data you downloaded previously into a table named `nyctaxi_sample`.

- Rewrites the arguments in the R script file to use the database name that you specify.

Run this script on the computer where you build the solution: for example, the laptop where you develop and test your R code. This computer, which we'll call the data science client, must be able to connect to the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] computer using the Named Pipes protocol.

1. Open a PowerShell command line **as administrator**.
  
2.  Navigate to the folder where you downloaded the scripts, and type the name of the script as shown. Press ENTER.

    ```
    .\RunSQL_R_Walkthrough.ps1
    ```
  
3.  You are prompted for each of the following parameters:
  
    **Database server name**: The name of the SQL Server instance where Machine learning Services or R Services is installed.

    Depending on your network's requirements, the instance name might require qualification with one or more subnet names.  For example, if MYSERVER doesn't work, try myserver.subnet.mycompany.com.
    
    **Name of the database you want to create**: For example, you might type **Tutorial** or **Taxi**

    **User name**: Provide an account that has databases access privileges. There are two options:
    
    + Type the name of a SQL login that has CREATE DATABASE privileges, and provide the SQL password on a successive prompt.
    + Press ENTER without typing any name to use your own Windows identity, and at the secured prompt, type your Windows password. PowerShell does not support entering a different Windows user name.
    + If you fail to specify a valid user, the script defaults to using integrated Windows authentication.
    
      > [!WARNING]
      > When you use the prompt in the PowerShell script to provide your credentials, the password is written to the updated script file in plain text. Edit the file to remove the credentials immediately after you have created the necessary R objects.
      
    **Path to the csv file**: Provide the full path to the data file. The default path and filename is `C:\tempR\nyctaxi1pct.csv`.
  
4.  Press ENTER to run the script.

    The script should download the file and load the data into the database automatically. This can take a while. Watch the status messages in the PowerShell window.
      
    If bulk import or any other step fails, you can load the data manually as described in the [Troubleshooting](#bkmk_Troubleshooting) section.

## <a name="bkmk_Troubleshooting"></a>Troubleshooting

If you have any problems with the PowerShell script, you can run all or any of the steps manually, using the lines of the PowerShell script as examples. This section lists some common issues and workarounds.

### PowerShell script didn't download the data

To download the data manually, right-click the following link and select **Save target as**.

[http://getgoing.blob.core.windows.net/public/nyctaxi1pct.csv](http://getgoing.blob.core.windows.net/public/nyctaxi1pct.csv)

Make a note of the path to the downloaded data file and the file name where the data was saved. You need the full path to load the data to the table using **bcp**.

### Unable to download the data

The data file is large. You must use a computer that has a relatively good Internet connection, or the download might time out.

### Could not connect or script failed

You might get this error when running one of the scripts:
*A network-related or instance-specific error has occurred while establishing a connection to SQL Server*

+ Check the spelling of your instance name.
+ Verify the complete connection string.
+ Depending on your network's requirements, the instance name might require qualification with one or more subnet names.  For example, if MYSERVER doesn't work, try myserver.subnet.mycompany.com.
+ Check whether Windows Firewall allows connections by SQL Server.
+ Try registering your server and making sure that it allows remote connections.
+ If you are using a named instance, enable SQL Browser to make connections easier.

### Network error or protocol not found

+ Verify that the instance supports remote connections.
+ Verify that the specified SQL user can connect remotely to the database.
+ Enable Named Pipes on the instance.
+ Check permissions for the account. The account that you specified might not have the permissions to create a new database and upload data.

### bcp did not run

+ Verify that the [bcp Utility](../../tools/bcp-utility.md) is available on your computer. You can run **bcp** from either a PowerShell window or a Windows command prompt.
+ If you get an error, add the location of the **bcp** utility to the PATH system environment variable and try again.

### The table schema was created but the table has no data

If the rest of the script ran without problems, you can upload the data to the table manually by calling **bcp** from the command line as follows:

#### Using a SQL login

~~~~
bcp TutorialDB.dbo.nyctaxi_sample in c:\tempR\nyctaxi1pct.csv -t ',' -S rtestserver.contoso.com -f C:\tempR\taxiimportfmt.xml -F 2 -C "RAW" -b 200000 -U <SQL login> -P <password>
~~~~

#### Using Windows authentication

~~~~
bcp TutorialDB.dbo.nyctaxi_sample in c:\tempR\nyctaxi1pct.csv -t ',' -S rtestserver.contoso.com -f C:\tempR\taxiimportfmt.xml -F 2 -C "RAW" -b 200000 -T
~~~~

+ The `in` keyword specifies the direction of data movement.
+ The  **-f** argument requires that you specify the full path of a format file. A format file is required if you use the **in** option.
+ Use the **-U** and **-P** arguments if running bcp with a SQL login.
+ Use the **-T** argument if you are using Windows integrated authentication.

If the script doesn't load the data, check the syntax, and verify that your server name is specified correctly for your network. For example, be sure to include any subnets, and include the computer name if you are connecting to a named instance. Verify that the login has the ability to perform bulk uploads.

### I want to run the script without prompts

You can specify all the parameters in a single command line, using this template, with values specific to your environment.

```
.\RunSQL_R_Walkthrough.ps1 -server <server address> -dbname <new db name> -u <user name> -p <password> -csvfilepath <path to csv file>
```

The following example runs the script using a SQL login:

```
.\RunSQL_R_Walkthrough.ps1 -server MyServer.subnet.domain.com -dbname MyDB –u SqlUserName –p SqlUsersPassword -csvfilepath C:\temp\nyctaxi1pct.csv
```

-   Connects to the specified instance and database using the credentials of *SqlUserName*.
-   Gets data from the file *C:\temp\nyctaxi1pct.csv*.
-   Loads the data into the table *dbo.nyctaxi_sample*, in the database *MyDB* on the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instance named *MyServer*.

### The data loaded but it contains duplicates

If your database contains an existing table of the same name and the same schema, **bcp** inserts a new copy of the data rather than overwriting existing data.

To avoid duplicate data, truncate any existing tables before running the script again.

## What's included in the sample

When you download the files from the GitHub repository, you get the following:

+ Data in CSV format; see [Training and scoring data](#bkmk_data) for details
+ A PowerShell script for preparing the environment
+ An XML format file for importing the data to SQL Server using bcp
+ Multiple T-SQL scripts
+ All the R code you need to run this walkthrough

### <a name="bkmk_data"></a>Training and scoring data

The data is a representative sampling of the New York City taxi data set, which contains records of over 173 million individual trips in 2013, including the fares and tip amounts paid for each trip. To make the data easier to work with, the Microsoft data science team performed downsampling to get just 1% of the data.  This data has been shared in a public blob storage container in Azure, in .CSV format. The source data is an uncompressed file, just under 350 MB.

+ Public dataset: [NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission] (http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml)

+ [Building Azure ML Models on the NYC Taxi Dataset](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/machinelearning/2015/04/02/building-azure-ml-models-on-the-nyc-taxi-dataset/.

### PowerShell and R script files

+ **RunSQL_R_Walkthrough.ps1** You run this script first, using PowerShell. It calls the SQL scripts to load data into the database.

+ **taxiimportfmt.xml** A format definition file that is used by the BCP utility to load data into the database.

+ **RSQL_R_Walkthrough.R**  This is the core R script that is used in rest of the lessons for doing your data analysis and modeling. It provides all the R code that you need to explore [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] data, build the classification model, and create plots.

### T-SQL script files

The PowerShell script executes multiple [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] scripts on the SQL Server instance. The following table lists the [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] scripts and what they do.

|SQL Script file name|Description|
|------------------------|----------------|
|create-db-tb-upload-data.sql|Creates database and two tables:<br /><br /> *nyctaxi_sample*: Table that stores the training data, a one-percent sample of the NYC taxi data set. A clustered columnstore index  is added to the table to improve storage and query performance.<br /><br /> *nyc_taxi_models*: A table used for storing trained models in binary format.|
|PredictTipBatchMode.sql|Creates a stored procedure that calls a trained model to predict the labels for new observations. It accepts a query as its input parameter.|
|PredictTipSingleMode.sql|Creates a stored procedure that calls a trained classification model to predict the labels for new observations. Variables of the new observations are passed in as in-line parameters.|
|PersistModel.sql|Creates a stored procedure that helps store the binary representation of the classification model in a table in the database.|
|fnCalculateDistance.sql|Creates a SQL scalar-valued function that calculates the direct distance between pick-up and drop-off locations.|
|fnEngineerFeatures.sql|Creates a SQL table-valued function that creates features for training the classification model|

The T-SQL queries used in this walkthrough have been tested and can be run as-is in your R code. However, if you want to experiment further or develop your own solution, we recommend that you use a dedicated SQL development environment to test and tune your queries first, before adding them to your R code.

+ The [mssql extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/tsql) for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a free, lightweight environment for running queries that also supports most database development tasks.
+ [SQL Server Management Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms) is a powerful but free tool provided for development and management of SQL Server databases.
