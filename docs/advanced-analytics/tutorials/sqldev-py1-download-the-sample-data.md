# Step 1: Download the sample data

This article is part of a tutorial, [In-database Python analytics for SQL developers](sqldev-in-database-python-for-sql-developers.md). 

Both the data and the scripts for this tutorial are shared on Github. In this step, you use a PowerShell script to download the data and script files to a local directory of your choosing.

## Run the script

1. Open a Windows PowerShell command console.

    Use the option, **Run as Administrator**, if administrative privileges are needed to create the destination directory or to write files to the specified destination.

2. Run the following PowerShell commands, changing the value of the parameter *DestDir* to any local directory.  The default we've used here is `C:\temp\pysql`.

    ```ps
    $source = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/Azure-MachineLearning-DataScience/master/Misc/PythonSQL/Download_Scripts_SQL_Walkthrough.ps1'
    $ps1_dest = "$pwd\Download_Scripts_SQL_Walkthrough.ps1"
    $wc = New-Object System.Net.WebClient
    $wc.DownloadFile($source, $ps1_dest)
    .\Download_Scripts_SQL_Walkthrough.ps1 â€“DestDir 'C:\temp\pysql'
    ```
    
    If the folder you specify in *DestDir* does not exist, it will be created by the PowerShell script.
    
    If you get an error, temporarily set the policy for execution of PowerShell scripts to **unrestricted** for this walkthrough, by using the **Bypass** argument and scoping the changes to the current session. Running this command does not result in a configuration change.
    
    ```ps
    Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process
    ```

3. Depending on your internet connection, the download might take a while. 

## View the results

When all files have been downloaded, the PowerShell script opens to the folder specified by  *DestDir*. 

+ In the PowerShell command prompt, run the following command, to list the files that were downloaded.

    ```ps
    ls
    ```
