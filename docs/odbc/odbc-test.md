# ODBC Test
MicrosoftÂ® ODBC Test is an ODBC-enabled application that you can use to test ODBC drivers and the ODBC Driver Manager. ODBC 3.51 includes both ANSI and Unicode-enabled versions of ODBC Test. The corresponding files are as follows:  
  
-   Odbcte32.exe and Gtrtst32.dll, for the ANSI version.  
  
-   Odbct32w.exe and Gtrts32w.dll, for the Unicode version.  
  
 To use ODBC Test, you must understand the ODBC API, the C language, and SQL. For more information about the ODBC API, see the [ODBC Programmer's Reference](../odbc/reference/odbc-programmer-s-reference.md).  
  
 Help topics that were formerly included within this section of the documentation are now contained within the ODBC Test program. Open Odbcte32.exe or Odbct32w.exe, open the **Help** menu, and then click **Help Topics**.  
  
 Note that the 64-bit versions of these applications, meant for 64-bit Microsoft Windows operating systems, have the same names as the 32-bit versions, even though they are separate files. i.e. the name for the Unicode version of the 64-bit version of ODBC Test is odbct32w.exe.
