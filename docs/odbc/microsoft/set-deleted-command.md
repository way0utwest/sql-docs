# SET DELETED Command
Specifies whether records marked for deletion are processed and whether they are available for use in other commands.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
SET DELETED ON | OFF  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 ON  
 (Default for the driver; the default for Visual FoxPro is OFF.) Specifies that commands that operate on records (including records in related tables) using a scope ignore records marked for deletion.  
  
 OFF  
 Specifies that records marked for deletion can be accessed by commands that operate on records (including records in related tables) using a scope.  
  
## Remarks  
 Queries that use DELETED( ) to test the status of records can be optimized using Visual FoxPro Rushmore technology if the table is indexed on DELETED( ).  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  SET DELETED is ignored if the default scope for the command is the current record or if you include a scope of a single record. INDEX always ignores SET DELETED and indexes all records in the table.
