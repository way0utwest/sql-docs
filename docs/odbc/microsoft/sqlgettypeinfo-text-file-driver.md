# SQLGetTypeInfo (Text File Driver)
> [!NOTE]  
>  This topic provides Text File Driver-specific information. For general information about this function, see the appropriate topic under [ODBC API Reference](../../odbc/reference/syntax/odbc-api-reference.md).  
  
 The name of the type (TYPE_NAME) returned in the table produced by **SQLGetTypeInfo** will be the name most commonly used by the data source.  
  
 SQL_ALL_EXCEPT_LIKE will be returned in the SEARCHABLE column for the Byte, Counter, Double, Single, Long, and Short data types. (The LIKE capability can be achieved by converting the value to a character using the ODBC canonical conversion functions, then performing the comparison.)  
  
 When the Text driver is used, **SQLGetTypeInfo** returns a CASE_SENSITIVE value of FALSE for the text data types (CHAR and LONGCHAR), when the data types actually are case-sensitive.
