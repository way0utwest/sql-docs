# Setting Up the Visual FoxPro ODBC Driver
For information about downloading and installing the Visual FoxPro ODBC driver, see [Visual FoxPro ODBC Driver](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=121318) on MSDN Downloads.  
  
 You use the Microsoft Visual FoxPro ODBC Driver Setup program to do the following:  
  
-   Add new components.  
  
-   Remove installed components.  
  
-   Reinstall to restore missing files and settings.  
  
-   Remove all previously installed components.  
  
 After you install the driver on your system, the Setup program recognizes the installed driver components and presents additional dialog boxes that enable you to change your driver's configuration.
