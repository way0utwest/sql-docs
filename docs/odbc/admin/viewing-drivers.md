# Viewing Drivers
To configure data sources, you must have installed at least one driver on your system. The **Drivers** tab in the **ODBC Data Source Administrator** dialog box lists all drivers installed on your computer, including the name, version, company, file name, and file creation date of each driver. You must use the driver's setup program to add or delete a driver from your system. For more information about modifying drivers, see [Managing Data Sources](../../odbc/admin/managing-data-sources.md).
