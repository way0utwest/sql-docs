# Writing ODBC 3.x Applications
When an ODBC 2.*x* application is upgraded to ODBC 3.*x*, it should be written such that it works with both ODBC 2.*x* and 3.*x* drivers. The application should incorporate conditional code to take full advantage of the ODBC 3.*x* features.  
  
 The SQL_ATTR_ODBC_VERSION environment attribute should be set to SQL_OV_ODBC2. This will ensure that the driver behaves like an ODBC 2*.x* driver with respect to the changes described in the section [Behavioral Changes](../../../odbc/reference/develop-app/behavioral-changes.md).  
  
 If the application will use any of the features described in the section [New Features](../../../odbc/reference/develop-app/new-features.md), conditional code should be used to determine whether the driver is an ODBC 3.*x* or ODBC 2*.x* driver. The application uses **SQLGetDiagField** and **SQLGetDiagRec** to obtain ODBC 3.*x* SQLSTATEs while doing error processing on these conditional code fragments. The following points about the new functionality should be considered:  
  
-   An application affected by the change in rowset size behavior should be careful not to call **SQLFetch** when the array size is greater than 1. These applications should replace calls to **SQLExtendedFetch** with calls to **SQLSetStmtAttr** to set the SQL_ATTR_ARRAY_STATUS_PTR statement attribute and to **SQLFetchScroll**, so that they have common code that works with both ODBC 3.*x* and ODBC 2.*x* drivers. Because **SQLSetStmtAttr** with SQL_ATTR_ROW_ARRAY_SIZE will be mapped to **SQLSetStmtAttr** with SQL_ROWSET_SIZE for ODBC 2.*x* drivers, applications can just set SQL_ATTR_ROW_ARRAY_SIZE for their multirow fetch operations.  
  
-   Most applications that are upgrading are not actually affected by changes in SQLSTATE codes. For those applications that are affected, they can do a mechanical search and replace in most cases using the error conversion table in the "SQLSTATE Mapping" section to convert ODBC 3.*x* error codes to ODBC 2*.x* codes. Since the ODBC 3*.x* Driver Manager will perform mapping from ODBC 2.*x* SQLSTATEs to ODBC 3.*x* SQLSTATEs, these application writers need only check for the ODBC 3.*x* SQLSTATEs and not worry about including ODBC 2.*x* SQLSTATEs in conditional code.  
  
-   If an application makes great use of date, time, and timestamp data types, the application can declare itself to be an ODBC 2.*x* application and use its existing code instead of using conditioning code.  
  
 The upgrade should also include the following steps:  
  
-   Call **SQLSetEnvAttr** before allocating a connection to set the SQL_ATTR_ODBC_VERSION environment attribute to SQL_OV_ODBC2.  
  
-   Replace all calls to **SQLAllocEnv**, **SQLAllocConnect**, or **SQLAllocStmt** with calls to **SQLAllocHandle** with the appropriate *HandleType* argument of SQL_HANDLE_ENV, SQL_HANDLE_DBC, or SQL_HANDLE_STMT.  
  
-   Replace all calls to **SQLFreeEnv** or **SQLFreeConnect** with calls to **SQLFreeHandle** with the appropriate *HandleType* argument of SQL_HANDLE_DBC or SQL_HANDLE_STMT.  
  
-   Replace all calls to **SQLSetConnectOption** with calls to **SQLSetConnectAttr**. If setting an attribute whose value is a string, set the *StringLength* argument appropriately. Change *Attribute* argument from SQL_XXXX to SQL_ATTR_XXXX.  
  
-   Replace all calls to **SQLGetConnectOption** with calls to **SQLGetConnectAttr**. If getting a string or binary attribute, set *BufferLength* to the appropriate value and pass in a *StringLength* argument. Change *Attribute* argument from SQL_XXXX to SQL_ATTR_XXXX.  
  
-   Replace all calls to **SQLSetStmtOption** with calls to **SQLSetStmtAttr**. If setting an attribute whose value is a string, set the *StringLength* argument appropriately. Change *Attribute* argument from SQL_XXXX to SQL_ATTR_XXXX.  
  
-   Replace all calls to **SQLGetStmtOption** with calls to **SQLGetStmtAttr**. If getting a string or binary attribute, set *BufferLength* to the appropriate value and pass in a *StringLength* argument. Change *Attribute* argument from SQL_XXXX to SQL_ATTR_XXXX.  
  
-   Replace all calls to **SQLTransact** with calls to **SQLEndTran**. If the rightmost valid handle in the **SQLTransact** call is an environment handle, a *HandleType* argument of SQL_HANDLE_ENV should be used in the **SQLEndTran** call with the appropriate *Handle* argument. If the rightmost valid handle in your **SQLTransact** call is a connection handle, a *HandleType* argument of SQL_HANDLE_DBC should be used in the **SQLEndTran** call with the appropriate *Handle* argument.  
  
-   Replace all calls to **SQLColAttributes** with calls to **SQLColAttribute**. If the *FieldIdentifier* argument is either SQL_COLUMN_PRECISION, SQL_COLUMN_SCALE, or SQL_COLUMN_LENGTH, do not change anything other than the name of the function. If not, change *FieldIdentifier* from SQL_COLUMN_XXXX to SQL_DESC_XXXX. If *FieldIdentifier* is SQL_DESC_CONCISE_TYPE and the data type is a datetime data type, change to the corresponding ODBC 3*.x* data type.  
  
-   If using block cursors, scrollable cursors, or both, the application does the following:  
  
    -   Sets the rowset size, cursor type, and cursor concurrency using **SQLSetStmtAttr**.  
  
    -   Calls **SQLSetStmtAttr** to set SQL_ATTR_ROW_STATUS_PTR to point to an array of status records.  
  
    -   Calls **SQLSetStmtAttr** to set SQL_ATTR_ROWS_FETCHED_PTR to point to an SQLINTEGER.  
  
    -   Performs the required bindings and executes the SQL statement.  
  
    -   Calls **SQLFetchScroll** in a loop to fetch rows and move around in the result set.  
  
    -   If it wants to fetch by bookmark, the application calls **SQLSetStmtAttr** to set SQL_ATTR_FETCH_BOOKMARK_PTR to a variable that will contain the bookmark for the row that it wants to fetch, and calls **SQLFetchScroll** with a *FetchOrientation* argument of SQL_FETCH_BOOKMARK.  
  
-   If using arrays of parameters, the application does the following:  
  
    -   Calls **SQLSetStmtAttr** to set the SQL_ATTR_PARAMSET_SIZE attribute to the size of the parameter array.  
  
    -   Calls **SQLSetStmtAttr** to set SQL_ATTR_ROWS_PROCESSED_PTR to point to an internal UDWORD variable.  
  
    -   Performs prepare, bind, and execute operations as appropriate.  
  
    -   If execution halts for some reason (such as SQL_NEED_DATA), it can find the "current" row of parameters by inspecting the location pointed to by SQL_ATTR_ROWS_PROCESSED_PTR.
