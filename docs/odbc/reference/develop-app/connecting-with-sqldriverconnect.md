# Connecting with SQLDriverConnect
**SQLDriverConnect** is used to connect to a data source using a connection string. **SQLDriverConnect** is used instead of **SQLConnect** for the following reasons:  
  
-   To let the application use driver-specific connection information.  
  
-   To request that the driver prompt the user for connection information.  
  
-   To connect without specifying a data source.  
  
 This section contains the following topics.  
  
-   [Driver-Specific Connection Information](../../../odbc/reference/develop-app/driver-specific-connection-information.md)  
  
-   [Prompting the User for Connection Information](../../../odbc/reference/develop-app/prompting-the-user-for-connection-information.md)  
  
-   [Connecting Using File Data Sources](../../../odbc/reference/develop-app/connecting-using-file-data-sources.md)  
  
-   [Connecting Directly to Drivers](../../../odbc/reference/develop-app/connecting-directly-to-drivers.md)
