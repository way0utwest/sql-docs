# Types of Changes
Three types of changes are made in ODBC 3.*x* (and any version of ODBC). Each of these affects backward compatibility differently and is handled in a different way. These changes are described in the following table.  
  
|Type of change|Description|  
|--------------------|-----------------|  
|New features|These are features that are new to ODBC 3.*x*, such as out-of-line binding or descriptors. These are implemented only when the application and driver, as well as the Driver Manager, are of version 3*.x*, so there is no attempt to make these backward compatible.|  
|Duplicated features|These are features that exist in ODBC 2*.x* and ODBC 3.*x* but are implemented in different ways in each. The functions **SQLAllocHandle** and **SQLAllocStmt** are an example. Backward compatibility issues for these and other duplicated features are mostly handled by mappings in the Driver Manager.|  
|Behavioral changes|These are features that are handled differently in ODBC 2*.x* and ODBC 3.*x*. A datetime **#define** is an example. These features are handled by the ODBC 3.*x* driver based on an environment attribute setting. (See [Behavioral Changes](../../../odbc/reference/develop-app/behavioral-changes.md) for more information.)|
