# Types of Applications
ODBC applications can be classified as follows:  
  
-   **Pure ODBC 2.**  
     ***x* Application** A 32-bit application that:  
  
    -   Calls only ODBC 2.*x* functions (including the ODBC 1.0 function **SQLSetParam**). These include ODBC 1.*x* applications that have been ported to 32-bit.  
  
    -   Expects ODBC 2.*x* behavior for features that have had behavioral changes. (See [Behavioral Changes](../../../odbc/reference/develop-app/behavioral-changes.md) for more information.)  
  
    -   Has not been recompiled with ODBC 3.5 headers.  
  
-   **Pure ODBC 2.**  
     ***x* Recompiled Application** A pure ODBC 2.*x* application that has been recompiled using the ODBC 3.5 header files, by setting ODBCVER=0x0250.  
  
-   **Pure ODBC 2.**  
     ***x* Unicode Application** A pure ODBC 2.*x* recompiled application that is Unicode-compliant and uses the SQL_WCHAR data type.  
  
-   **Pure Open Group and ISO**â€“**compliant ODBC Application** A 32-bit application that:  
  
    -   Calls functions defined in the Open Group or ISO CLI standards. (These functions may include deprecated 3.0 functions.)  
  
    -   Does not use the Unicode data types.  
  
    -   Expects ODBC 3.0 behavior for features that have had behavioral changes.  
  
-   **Pure ODBC 3.0 Application** A 32-bit application that:  
  
    -   Is compiled with 3.0 headers.  
  
    -   Calls any ODBC 3.0 function, possibly including those that are deprecated.  
  
    -   Expects ODBC 3.0 behavior for features that have had behavioral changes.  
  
-   **Pure ODBC 3.5 Application** A 32 or 64-bit application that:  
  
    -   May use Unicode data types.  
  
    -   Calls any ODBC 3.5 function, possibly including those that are deprecated.  
  
    -   Expects ODBC 3.5 behavior for features that have had behavioral changes.  
  
-   **Pure ODBC 3.8 (or later) Application** A 32-bit or 64-bit application that:  
  
    -   May use Unicode data types.  
  
    -   Calls any ODBC 3.8 function, possibly including those that are deprecated.  
  
    -   Expects ODBC 3.8 behavior for features that have had behavioral changes.  
  
-   **Replaced Application** A 32 or 64-bit application that:  
  
    -   Implements new behavior for duplicated functionality.  
  
    -   Uses any new features in a later version of ODBC only within conditional code.  
  
    -   Has limited conditional code to handle behavioral changes or has registered itself to be an earlier version of ODBC application.
