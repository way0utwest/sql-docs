# Diagnostic Tools
Two facilities can assist with diagnosing problems in ODBC applications. Both are available from the ODBC Administrator and implemented by the Driver Manager. *Tracing* provides a means to record to a log file the sequence of function calls. Visual Studio Analyzer allows the analysis of information about the interaction of components in a distributed environment.  
  
 This section contains the following topics.  
  
-   [Tracing](../../../odbc/reference/develop-app/tracing.md)  
  
-   [Visual Studio Analyzer](../../../odbc/reference/develop-app/visual-studio-analyzer.md)
