# Schema Views
An application can retrieve metadata information from the DBMS either by calling ODBC catalog functions or by using INFORMATION_SCHEMA views. The views are defined by the ANSI SQL-92 standard.  
  
 If supported by the DBMS and the driver, the INFORMATION_SCHEMA views provide a more powerful and comprehensive means of retrieving metadata than the ODBC catalog functions provide. An application can execute its own custom **SELECT** statement against one of these views, can join views, or can perform a union on views. While offering greater utility and a wider range of metadata, INFORMATION_SCHEMA views are not often supported by the DBMS. This might change as more DBMSs and drivers achieve compliance with SQL-92.  
  
 To determine which views are supported, an application calls **SQLGetInfo** with the SQL_INFO_SCHEMA_VIEWS option. To retrieve metadata from a supported view, the application executes a **SELECT** statement that specifies the schema information required.
