# Asynchronous Execution
ODBC supports asynchronous operations for both statement and connection operations. There are two ways to determine when an asynchronous operation is complete:  
  
1.  [Asynchronous Execution (Polling Method)](../../../odbc/reference/develop-app/asynchronous-execution-polling-method.md)  
  
2.  [Asynchronous Execution (Notification Method)](../../../odbc/reference/develop-app/asynchronous-execution-notification-method.md)
