# Checking Feature Support and Variability
To check feature support and variability, applications generally call **SQLGetInfo**, **SQLGetFunctions**, and **SQLGetTypeInfo**. A good starting place is the driver's API and SQL grammar conformance levels. These describe broad levels of feature support. The application can then call **SQLGetInfo** with other options to determine the support or variability of features it needs, **SQLGetFunctions** to determine whether functions it needs beyond the returned conformance level are supported, and **SQLGetTypeInfo** to determine what SQL data types are supported.  
  
 An application can determine whether a statement or connection attribute is supported by calling **SQLSetStmtAttr** or **SQLSetConnectAttr** with that attribute. If the function returns SQL_SUCCESS or SQL_SUCCESS_WITH_INFO, the attribute is supported; if it returns SQL_ERROR and SQLSTATE HYC00 (Optional feature not implemented), the attribute is not supported.  
  
 Applications can also determine a limited amount of information before connecting to the driver by calling **SQLDrivers**.
