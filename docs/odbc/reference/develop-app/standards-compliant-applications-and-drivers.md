# Standards-Compliant Applications and Drivers
A standards-compliant application or driver is one that conforms to the Open Group CAE Specification "Data Management: SQL Call-Level Interface (CLI)," and the ISO/IEC 9075-3:1995 (E) Call-Level Interface (SQL/CLI).  
  
 ODBC 3*.x* guarantees the following features:  
  
-   An application written to the Open Group and ISO CLI specifications will work with an ODBC 3*.x* driver or a standards-compliant driver when it is compiled with the ODBC 3*.x* header files and linked with ODBC 3*.x* libraries, and when it gains access to the driver through the ODBC 3*.x* Driver Manager.  
  
-   A driver written to the Open Group and ISO CLI specifications will work with an ODBC 3*.x* application or a standards-compliant application when it is compiled with the ODBC 3*.x* header files and linked with ODBC 3*.x* libraries, and when the application gains access to the driver through the ODBC 3*.x* Driver Manager.  
  
 Standards-compliant applications and drivers are compiled with the ODBC_STD compile flag.  
  
 Standards-compliant applications exhibit the following behavior:  
  
-   If a standards-compliant application calls **SQLAllocEnv** (which can occur because **SQLAllocEnv** is a valid function in the Open Group and ISO CLI), the call is mapped to **SQLAllocHandleStd** at compile time. As a result, at run time, the application calls **SQLAllocHandleStd**. During the course of processing this call, the Driver Manager sets the SQL_ATTR_ODBC_VERSION environment attribute to SQL_OV_ODBC3. A call to **SQLAllocHandleStd** is equivalent to a call to **SQLAllocHandle** with a *HandleType* of SQL_HANDLE_ENV and a call to **SQLSetEnvAttr** to set SQL_ATTR_ODBC_VERSION to SQL_OV_ODBC3.  
  
-   If a standards-compliant application calls **SQLBindParam** (which can occur because **SQLBindParam** is a valid function in the Open Group and ISO CLI), the ODBC 3*.x* Driver Manager maps the call to the equivalent call in **SQLBindParameter**. (See [SQLBindParam Mapping](../../../odbc/reference/appendixes/sqlbindparam-mapping.md) in Appendix G: Driver Guidelines for Backward Compatibility.)  
  
-   To align with the ISO CLI, the ODBC 3*.x* header files contain aliases for information types used in calls to **SQLGetInfo**. A standards-compliant application can use these aliases instead of the ODBC 3*.x* information types. For more information, see the next topic, [Header Files](../../../odbc/reference/develop-app/header-files.md).  
  
-   A standards-compliant application must verify that all features it supports are supported in the driver it will work with. Setting the SQL_ATTR_CURSOR_SCROLLABLE statement attribute to SQL_SCROLLABLE and setting the SQL_ATTR_CURSOR_SENSITIVITY statement attribute to SQL_INSENSITIVE or SQL_SENSITIVE are capabilities that are available as optional features in the standards but are not included in the ODBC 3*.x* Core level and therefore might not be supported by all ODBC 3*.x* drivers. If a standards-compliant application uses these capabilities, it should verify that the driver that it will work with supports them.
