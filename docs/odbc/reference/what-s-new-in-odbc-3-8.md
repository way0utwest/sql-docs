# What&#39;s New in ODBC 3.8
Windows 8 includes an updated version of ODBC 3.8. ODBC 3.8 in Windows 8 includes the following features:  
  
-   [Driver-Aware Connection Pooling](../../odbc/reference/develop-app/driver-aware-connection-pooling.md)  
  
-   [Asynchronous Execution (Notification Method)](../../odbc/reference/develop-app/asynchronous-execution-notification-method.md)  
  
-   [Data Access Tracing (Windows 8)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/hh829624.aspx)  
  
-   PowerShell commands have been added to help you manage ODBC data sources, ODBC drivers, ODBC Performance Counter, and data access tracing at the command line.  For more information see [Windows Data Access Components PowerShell Commands](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/jj134064.aspx).  
  
 Windows 7 includes an updated version of ODBC, ODBC 3.8. ODBC 3.8 includes the following features:  
  
-   Executing connection operations asynchronously. For more information, see [Asynchronous Execution (Polling Method)](../../odbc/reference/develop-app/asynchronous-execution-polling-method.md).  
  
-   Streamed output parameters. For more information, see [Retrieving Output Parameters Using SQLGetData](../../odbc/reference/develop-app/retrieving-output-parameters-using-sqlgetdata.md).  
  
-   ODBC C data type extensibility. For more information, see [C Data Types in ODBC](../../odbc/reference/develop-app/c-data-types-in-odbc.md).  
  
 Driver writers should read [Upgrading a 3.5 Driver to a 3.8 Driver](../../odbc/reference/develop-driver/upgrading-a-3-5-driver-to-a-3-8-driver.md).  
  
 Asynchronous connection operations can be used by ODBC 3.x and ODBC 2.x applications with an ODBC 3.8 driver.  
  
 For more information, see [Compatibility Matrix](../../odbc/reference/develop-app/compatibility-matrix.md).
