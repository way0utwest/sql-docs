# ODBC Driver Architecture
Driver writers must be aware that the driver architecture can affect whether an application can use DBMS-specific SQL.  
  
 ![Shows the ODBC driver architecture](../../../odbc/reference/develop-driver/media/odbcdriverovruarch.gif "ODBCDriverOvruArch")  
  
 [File-based Drivers](../../../odbc/reference/file-based-drivers.md)  
  
 When the driver accesses the physical data directly, the driver acts as both driver and data source. The driver must process both ODBC calls and SQL statements. Developers of file-based drivers must write their own database engines.  
  
 [DBMS-Based Drivers](../../../odbc/reference/dbms-based-drivers.md)  
  
 When a separate database engine is used to access physical data, the driver processes only ODBC calls. It passes SQL statements to the database engine for processing.  
  
 [Network Architecture](../../../odbc/reference/network-example.md)  
  
 File and DBMS ODBC configurations can exist on a single network.  
  
 [Other Driver Architectures](../../../odbc/reference/other-driver-architectures.md)  
  
 When a driver is required to work with a variety of data sources, it can be used as middleware. Heterogeneous join engine architecture can make the driver appear as a driver manager. Drivers can also be installed on servers, where they can be shared by a series of clients.  
  
 For more information about driver architecture, see [Driver Manager](../../../odbc/reference/the-driver-manager.md) and [Driver Architecture](../../../odbc/reference/driver-architecture.md) in the section on [ODBC Architecture](../../../odbc/reference/odbc-architecture.md).
