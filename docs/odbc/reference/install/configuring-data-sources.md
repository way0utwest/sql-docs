# Configuring Data Sources
Information about data sources is stored in the system registry. Users modify data source information through an administration program. This can be the ODBC Administrator, the ODBC Control Panel device, or an administration program written by an application or driver developer.  
  
 You can use PowerShell commands to modify data sources. For more information about these PowerShell commands, see [Windows Data Access Components PowerShell Commands](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/jj134064.aspx).
