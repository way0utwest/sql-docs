# ODBC Data Sources Subkey
The values under the ODBC Data Sources subkey list the data sources. The format of these values is as shown in the following table.  
  
|Name|Data type|Data|  
|----------|---------------|----------|  
|*data-source-name*|REG_SZ|*driver-description*|  
  
 The *data-source-name* value is defined by the administration program (which usually prompts the user for it), and *driver-description* is defined by the driver developer (it is usually the name of the DBMS associated with the driver).  
  
 For example, suppose three data sources have been defined: Inventory, which uses SQL Server; Payroll, which uses dBASE; and Personnel, which uses formatted text files. The values under the ODBC Data Sources subkey might be as follows:  
  
```  
Inventory : REG_SZ : SQL Server  
Payroll : REG_SZ : dBASE  
Personnel : REG_SZ : Text  
```
