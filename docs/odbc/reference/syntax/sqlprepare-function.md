# SQLPrepare Function
**Conformance**  
 Version Introduced: ODBC 1.0 Standards Compliance: ISO 92  
  
 **Summary**  
 **SQLPrepare** prepares an SQL string for execution.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
SQLRETURN SQLPrepare(  
     SQLHSTMT      StatementHandle,  
     SQLCHAR *     StatementText,  
     SQLINTEGER    TextLength);  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 *StatementHandle*  
 [Input] Statement handle.  
  
 *StatementText*  
 [Input] SQL text string.  
  
 *TextLength*  
 [Input] Length of **StatementText* in characters.  
  
## Returns  
 SQL_SUCCESS, SQL_SUCCESS_WITH_INFO, SQL_STILL_EXECUTING, SQL_ERROR, or SQL_INVALID_HANDLE.  
  
## Diagnostics  
 When **SQLPrepare** returns SQL_ERROR or SQL_SUCCESS_WITH_INFO, an associated SQLSTATE value can be obtained by calling **SQLGetDiagRec** with a *HandleType* of SQL_HANDLE_STMT and a *Handle* of *StatementHandle*. The following table lists the SQLSTATE values commonly returned by **SQLPrepare** and explains each one in the context of this function; the notation "(DM)" precedes the descriptions of SQLSTATEs returned by the Driver Manager. The return code associated with each SQLSTATE value is SQL_ERROR, unless noted otherwise.

|01000|General warning|Driver-specific informational message. (Function returns SQL_SUCCESS_WITH_INFO.)|  
|01S02|Option value changed|A specified statement attribute was invalid because of implementation working conditions, so a similar value was temporarily substituted. (**SQLGetStmtAttr** can be called to determine what the temporarily substituted value is.) The substitute value is valid for the *StatementHandle* until the cursor is closed. The statement attributes that can be changed are: SQL_ATTR_CONCURRENCY SQL_ATTR_CURSOR_TYPE SQL_ATTR_KEYSET_SIZE SQL_ATTR_MAX_LENGTH SQL_ATTR_MAX_ROWS SQL_ATTR_QUERY_TIMEOUT SQL_ATTR_SIMULATE_CURSOR<br /><br /> (Function returns SQL_SUCCESS_WITH_INFO.)|

## Comments  
 The application calls **SQLPrepare** to send an SQL statement to the data source for preparation. For more information about prepared execution, see [Prepared Execution](../../../odbc/reference/develop-app/prepared-execution-odbc.md). The application can include one or more parameter markers in the SQL statement. To include a parameter marker, the application embeds a question mark (?) into the SQL string at the appropriate position. For information about parameters, see [Statement Parameters](../../../odbc/reference/develop-app/statement-parameters.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  If an application uses **SQLPrepare** to prepare and **SQLExecute** to submit a **COMMIT** or **ROLLBACK** statement, it will not be interoperable between DBMS products. To commit or roll back a transaction, call **SQLEndTran**.  
  
 The driver can modify the statement to use the form of SQL used by the data source and then submit it to the data source for preparation. In particular, the driver modifies the escape sequences used to define SQL syntax for certain features. (For a description of SQL statement grammar, see [Escape Sequences in ODBC](../../../odbc/reference/develop-app/escape-sequences-in-odbc.md) and [Appendix C: SQL Grammar](../../../odbc/reference/appendixes/appendix-c-sql-grammar.md).) For the driver, a statement handle is similar to a statement identifier in embedded SQL code. If the data source supports statement identifiers, the driver can send a statement identifier and parameter values to the data source.  
  
 After a statement is prepared, the application uses the statement handle to refer to the statement in later function calls. The prepared statement associated with the statement handle can be re-executed by calling **SQLExecute** until the application frees the statement with a call to **SQLFreeStmt** with the SQL_DROP option or until the statement handle is used in a call to **SQLPrepare**, **SQLExecDirect**, or one of the catalog functions (**SQLColumns**, **SQLTables**, and so on). Once the application prepares a statement, it can request information about the format of the result set. For some implementations, calling **SQLDescribeCol** or **SQLDescribeParam** after **SQLPrepare** might not be as efficient as calling the function after **SQLExecute** or **SQLExecDirect**.  
  
 Some drivers cannot return syntax errors or access violations when the application calls **SQLPrepare**. A driver can handle syntax errors and access violations, only syntax errors, or neither syntax errors nor access violations. Therefore, an application must be able to handle these conditions when calling subsequent related functions such as **SQLNumResultCols**, **SQLDescribeCol**, **SQLColAttribute**, and **SQLExecute**.  
  
 Depending on the capabilities of the driver and data source, parameter information (such as data types) might be checked when the statement is prepared (if all parameters have been bound) or when it is executed (if all parameters have not been bound). For maximum interoperability, an application should unbind all parameters that applied to an old SQL statement before preparing a new SQL statement on the same statement. This prevents errors that are due to old parameter information being applied to the new statement.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  Committing a transaction, either by explicitly calling **SQLEndTran** or by working in autocommit mode, can cause the data source to delete the access plans for all statements on a connection. For more information, see the SQL_CURSOR_COMMIT_BEHAVIOR and SQL_CURSOR_ROLLBACK_BEHAVIOR information types in [SQLGetInfo](../../../odbc/reference/syntax/sqlgetinfo-function.md) and [Effect of Transactions on Cursors and Prepared Statements](../../../odbc/reference/develop-app/effect-of-transactions-on-cursors-and-prepared-statements.md).
