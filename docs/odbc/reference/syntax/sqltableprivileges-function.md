# SQLTablePrivileges Function
**Conformance**  
 Version Introduced: ODBC 1.0 Standards Compliance: ODBC  
  
 **Summary**  
 **SQLTablePrivileges** returns a list of tables and the privileges associated with each table. The driver returns the information as a result set on the specified statement.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
SQLRETURN SQLTablePrivileges(  
     SQLHSTMT      StatementHandle,  
     SQLCHAR *     CatalogName,  
     SQLSMALLINT   NameLength1,  
     SQLCHAR *     SchemaName,  
     SQLSMALLINT   NameLength2,  
     SQLCHAR *     TableName,  
     SQLSMALLINT   NameLength3);  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 *StatementHandle*  
 [Input] Statement handle.  
  
 *CatalogName*  
 [Input] Table catalog. If a driver supports catalogs for some tables but not for others, such as when the driver retrieves data from different DBMSs, an empty string ("") denotes those tables that do not have catalogs. *CatalogName* cannot contain a string search pattern.  
  
 If the SQL_ATTR_METADATA_ID statement attribute is set to SQL_TRUE, *CatalogName* is treated as an identifier and its case is not significant. If it is SQL_FALSE, *CatalogName* is an ordinary argument; it is treated literally, and its case is significant. For more information, see [Arguments in Catalog Functions](../../../odbc/reference/develop-app/arguments-in-catalog-functions.md).  
  
 *NameLength1*  
 [Input] Length in characters of **CatalogName*.  
  
 *SchemaName*  
 [Input] String search pattern for schema names. If a driver supports schemas for some tables but not for others, such as when the driver retrieves data from different DBMSs, an empty string ("") denotes those tables that do not have schemas.  
  
 If the SQL_ATTR_METADATA_ID statement attribute is set to SQL_TRUE, *SchemaName* is treated as an identifier and its case is not significant. If it is SQL_FALSE, *SchemaName* is a pattern value argument; it is treated literally, and its case is significant.  
  
 *NameLength2*  
 [Input] Length in characters of **SchemaName*.  
  
 *TableName*  
 [Input] String search pattern for table names.  
  
 If the SQL_ATTR_METADATA_ID statement attribute is set to SQL_TRUE, *TableName* is treated as an identifier and its case is not significant. If it is SQL_FALSE, *TableName* is a pattern value argument; it is treated literally, and its case is significant.  
  
 *NameLength3*  
 [Input] Length in characters of **TableName*.  
  
## Returns  
 SQL_SUCCESS, SQL_SUCCESS_WITH_INFO, SQL_STILL_EXECUTING, SQL_ERROR, or SQL_INVALID_HANDLE.  
  
## Diagnostics  
 When **SQLTablePrivileges** returns SQL_ERROR or SQL_SUCCESS_WITH_INFO, an associated SQLSTATE value may be obtained by calling **SQLGetDiagRec** with a *HandleType* of SQL_HANDLE_STMT and a *Handle* of *StatementHandle*. The following table lists the SQLSTATE values commonly returned by **SQLTablePrivileges** and explains each one in the context of this function; the notation "(DM)" precedes the descriptions of SQLSTATEs returned by the Driver Manager. The return code associated with each SQLSTATE value is SQL_ERROR, unless noted otherwise.  
  
|SQLSTATE|Error|Description|  
|--------------|-----------|-----------------|  
|01000|General warning|Driver-specific informational message. (Function returns SQL_SUCCESS_WITH_INFO.)|  
|08S01|Communication link failure|The communication link between the driver and the data source to which the driver was connected failed before the function completed processing.|  
|24000|Invalid cursor state|A cursor was open on the *StatementHandle*, and **SQLFetch** or **SQLFetchScroll** had been called. This error is returned by the Driver Manager if **SQLFetch** or **SQLFetchScroll** has not returned SQL_NO_DATA and is returned by the driver if **SQLFetch** or **SQLFetchScroll** has returned SQL_NO_DATA.<br /><br /> A cursor was open on the *StatementHandle*, but **SQLFetch** or **SQLFetchScroll** had not been called.|  
|40001|Serialization failure|The transaction was rolled back due to a resource deadlock with another transaction.|  
|40003|Statement completion unknown|The associated connection failed during the execution of this function, and the state of the transaction cannot be determined.|  
|HY000|General error|An error occurred for which there was no specific SQLSTATE and for which no implementation-specific SQLSTATE was defined. The error message returned by **SQLGetDiagRec** in the *\*MessageText* buffer describes the error and its cause.|  
|HY001|Memory allocation  error|The driver was unable to allocate memory required to support execution or completion of the function.|  
|HY008|Operation canceled|Asynchronous processing was enabled for the *StatementHandle*. The **SQLTablePrivileges** function was called, and before it completed execution, **SQLCancel** or **SQLCancelHandle** was called on the *StatementHandle*. Then the **SQLTablePrivileges** function was called again on the *StatementHandle*.<br /><br /> The **SQLTablePrivileges** function was called, and before it completed execution, **SQLCancel** or **SQLCancelHandle** was called on the *StatementHandle* from a different thread in a multithread application.|  
|HY009|Invalid use of null pointer|The SQL_ATTR_METADATA_ID statement attribute was set to SQL_TRUE, the *CatalogName* argument was a null pointer, and the SQL_CATALOG_NAME *InfoType* returns that catalog names are supported.<br /><br /> (DM) The SQL_ATTR_METADATA_ID statement attribute was set to SQL_TRUE, and the *SchemaName* or *TableName* argument was a null pointer.|  
|HY010|Function sequence  error|(DM) An asynchronously executing function was called for the connection handle that is associated with the *StatementHandle*. This asynchronous function was still executing when the **SQLTablePrivileges** function was called.<br /><br /> (DM) **SQLExecute**, **SQLExecDirect**, or **SQLMoreResults** was called for the *StatementHandle* and returned SQL_PARAM_DATA_AVAILABLE. This function was called before data was retrieved for all streamed parameters.<br /><br /> (DM) An asynchronously executing function (not this one) was called for the *StatementHandle* and was still executing when this function was called.<br /><br /> (DM) **SQLExecute**, **SQLExecDirect**, **SQLBulkOperations**, or **SQLSetPos** was called for the *StatementHandle* and returned SQL_NEED_DATA. This function was called before data was sent for all data-at-execution parameters or columns.|  
|HY013|Memory management error|The function call could not be processed because the underlying memory objects could not be accessed, possibly because of low memory conditions.|  
|HY090|Invalid string or buffer length|(DM) The value of one of the name length arguments was less than 0 but not equal to SQL_NTS.<br /><br /> The value of one of the name length arguments exceeded the maximum length value for the corresponding qualifier or name.|  
|HY117|Connection is suspended due to unknown transaction state. Only disconnect and read-only functions are allowed.|(DM) For more information about the suspended state, see [SQLEndTran Function](../../../odbc/reference/syntax/sqlendtran-function.md).|  
|HYC00|Optional feature not implemented|A catalog was specified, and the driver or data source does not support catalogs.<br /><br /> A schema was specified, and the driver or data source does not support schemas.<br /><br /> A string search pattern was specified for the table schema, table name, or column name, and the data source does not support search patterns for one or more of those arguments.<br /><br /> The combination of the current settings of the SQL_ATTR_CONCURRENCY and SQL_ATTR_CURSOR_TYPE statement attributes was not supported by the driver or data source.<br /><br /> The SQL_ATTR_USE_BOOKMARKS statement attribute was set to SQL_UB_VARIABLE, and the SQL_ATTR_CURSOR_TYPE statement attribute was set to a cursor type for which the driver does not support bookmarks.|  
|HYT00|Timeout expired|The query timeout period expired before the data source returned the result set. The timeout period is set through **SQLSetStmtAttr**, SQL_ATTR_QUERY_TIMEOUT.|  
|HYT01|Connection timeout expired|The connection timeout period expired before the data source responded to the request. The connection timeout period is set through **SQLSetConnectAttr**, SQL_ATTR_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT.|  
|IM001|Driver does not support this function|(DM) The driver associated with the *StatementHandle* does not support the function.|  
|IM017|Polling is disabled in asynchronous notification mode|Whenever the notification model is used, polling is disabled.|  
|IM018|**SQLCompleteAsync** has not been called to complete the previous asynchronous operation on this handle.|If the previous function call on the handle returns SQL_STILL_EXECUTING and if notification mode is enabled, **SQLCompleteAsync** must be called on the handle to do post-processing and complete the operation.|  
  
## Comments  
 The *SchemaName* and *TableName* arguments accept search patterns. For more information about valid search patterns, see [Pattern Value Arguments](../../../odbc/reference/develop-app/pattern-value-arguments.md).  
  
 **SQLTablePrivileges** returns the results as a standard result set, ordered by TABLE_CAT, TABLE_SCHEM, TABLE_NAME, PRIVILEGE, and GRANTEE.  
  
 To determine the actual lengths of the TABLE_CAT, TABLE_SCHEM, and TABLE_NAME columns, an application can call **SQLGetInfo** with the SQL_MAX_CATALOG_NAME_LEN, SQL_MAX_SCHEMA_NAME_LEN, and SQL_MAX_TABLE_NAME_LEN options.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  For more information about the general use, arguments, and returned data of ODBC catalog functions, see [Catalog Functions](../../../odbc/reference/develop-app/catalog-functions.md).  
  
 The following columns have been renamed for ODBC 3*.x*. The column name changes do not affect backward compatibility because applications bind by column number.  
  
|ODBC 2.0 column|ODBC 3*.x* column|  
|---------------------|-----------------------|  
|TABLE_QUALIFIER|TABLE_CAT|  
|TABLE_OWNER|TABLE_SCHEM|  
  
 The following table lists the columns in the result set. Additional columns beyond column 7 (IS_GRANTABLE) can be defined by the driver. An application should gain access to driver-specific columns by counting down from the end of the result set rather than specifying an explicit ordinal position. For more information, see [Data Returned by Catalog Functions](../../../odbc/reference/develop-app/data-returned-by-catalog-functions.md).  
  
|Column name|Column number|Data type|Comments|  
|-----------------|-------------------|---------------|--------------|  
|TABLE_CAT (ODBC 1.0)|1|Varchar|Catalog name; NULL if not applicable to the data source. If a driver supports catalogs for some tables but not for others, such as when the driver retrieves data from different DBMSs, it returns an empty string ("") for those tables that do not have catalogs.|  
|TABLE_SCHEM  (ODBC 1.0)|2|Varchar|Schema name; NULL if not applicable to the data source. If a driver supports schemas for some tables but not for others, such as when the driver retrieves data from different DBMSs, it returns an empty string ("") for those tables that do not have schemas.|  
|TABLE_NAME (ODBC 1.0)|3|Varchar not NULL|Table name.|  
|GRANTOR (ODBC 1.0)|4|Varchar|Name of the user who granted the privilege; NULL if not applicable to the data source.<br /><br /> For all rows in which the value in the GRANTEE column is the owner of the object, the GRANTOR column will be "_SYSTEM".|  
|GRANTEE (ODBC 1.0)|5|Varchar not NULL|Name of the user to whom the privilege was granted.|  
|PRIVILEGE (ODBC 1.0)|6|Varchar not NULL|The table privilege. May be one of the following or a data source–specific privilege.<br /><br /> SELECT: The grantee is permitted to retrieve data for one or more columns of the table.<br /><br /> INSERT: The grantee is permitted to insert new rows containing data for one or more columns into the table.<br /><br /> UPDATE: The grantee is permitted to update the data in one or more columns of the table.<br /><br /> DELETE: The grantee is permitted to delete rows of data from the table.<br /><br /> REFERENCES: The grantee is permitted to refer to one or more columns of the table within a constraint (for example, a unique, referential, or table check constraint).<br /><br /> The scope of action permitted the grantee by a given table privilege is data source–dependent. For example, the UPDATE privilege might permit the grantee to update all columns in a table on one data source and only those columns for which the grantor has the UPDATE privilege on another data source.|  
|IS_GRANTABLE (ODBC 1.0)|7|Varchar|Indicates whether the grantee is permitted to grant the privilege to other users; "YES", "NO", or NULL if unknown or not applicable to the data source.<br /><br /> A privilege is either grantable or not grantable but not both. The result set returned by **SQLColumnPrivileges** will never contain two rows for which all columns except the IS_GRANTABLE column contain the same value.|
