-   As both *expressions* in a *comparison-predicate*  
  
-   As both operands of a binary operator  
  
-   As both the first and second operands of a **BETWEEN** operation  
  
-   As both the first and third operands of a **BETWEEN** operation  
  
-   As both the expression and the first value of an **IN** operation  
  
-   As the operand of a unary + or â€“ operation  
  
-   As the argument of a *set-function-reference*
