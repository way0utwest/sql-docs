# Returning SQL_NO_DATA
When an ODBC 2.*x* application workingwith an ODBC 3*.x* driver calls **SQLExecDirect**, **SQLExecute**, or **SQLParamData**, and a searched update or delete statement was executed but did not affect any rows at the data source, the ODBC 3*.x* driver should return SQL_SUCCESS. When an ODBC 3*.x* application working with an ODBC 3*.x* driver calls **SQLExecDirect**, **SQLExecute**, or **SQLParamData** with the same result, the ODBC 3*.x* driver should return SQL_NO_DATA.  
  
 If a searched update or delete statement in a batch of statements does not affect any rows at the data source, **SQLMoreResults** returns SQL_SUCCESS. It cannot return SQL_NO_DATA, because that would mean that there are no more results, not that there is a result from a searched update/delete that affected no rows.
