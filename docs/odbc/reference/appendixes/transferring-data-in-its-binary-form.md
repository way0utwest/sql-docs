# Transferring Data in Its Binary Form
An application can safely transfer data (in the internal form used by a specified DBMS) between two data sources that use the same DBMS and hardware platform. For a given piece of data, the SQL data types must be the same in the source and target data sources. The C data type is SQL_C_BINARY.  
  
 When the application calls **SQLFetch**, **SQLFetchScroll**, or **SQLGetData** to retrieve the data from the source data source, the driver retrieves the data from the data source and transfers it, without conversion, to a storage location of type SQL_C_BINARY. When the application calls **SQLBulkOperations**, **SQLExecute**, **SQLExecDirect**, **SQLPutData, or SQLSetPos** to send the data to the target data source, the driver retrieves the data from the storage location and transfers it, without conversion, to the target data source.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Applications that transfer any data (except binary data) in this manner are not interoperable among DBMSs.  
  
 **SQLCopyDesc** can be used to copy row bindings from the source DBMS to parameter bindings in the target DBMS.
