# ODBC Glossary
## A  
 **access plan**  
 A plan generated by the database engine to execute an SQL statement. Equivalent to executable code compiled from a third-generation language such as C.  
  
 **aggregate function**  
 A function that generates a single value from a group of values, often used with **GROUP BY** and **HAVING** clauses. Aggregate functions include **AVG**, **COUNT**, **MAX**, **MIN**, and **SUM**. Also known as *set functions*. *See also* scalar function.  
  
 **ANSI**  
 American National Standards Institute. The ODBC API is based on the ANSI Call-Level Interface.  
  
 **APD**  
 *See* application parameter descriptor (APD).  
  
 **API**  
 Application Programming Interface. A set of routines that an application uses to request and carry out lower-level services. The ODBC API is composed of the ODBC functions.  
  
 **application**  
 An executable program that calls functions in the ODBC API.  
  
 **application parameter descriptor (APD)**  
 A descriptor that describes the dynamic parameters used in an SQL statement before any conversion specified by the application.  
  
 **application row descriptor (ARD)**  
 A descriptor that represents the column metadata and data in the application's buffers, describing a row of data following any data conversion specified by the application.  
  
 **ARD**  
 *See* application row descriptor (ARD).  
  
 **auto-commit mode**  
 A transaction commit mode in which transactions are committed immediately after they are executed.  
  
## B  
 **behavioral change**  
 A change in certain functionality from ODBC 3*.x* behavior to ODBC 2.*x* behavior, or vice versa. Caused by changing the SQL_ATTR_ODBC_VERSION environment attribute.  
  
 **Binary large object (BLOB)**  
 Any binary data over a certain number of bytes, such as 255. Typically much longer. Such data is generally sent to and retrieved from the data source in parts. Also known as *long data*.  
  
 **binding**  
 As a verb, the act of associating a column in a result set or a parameter in an SQL statement with an application variable. As a noun, the association.  
  
 **binding offset**  
 A value added to the data buffer addresses and length/indicator buffer addresses for all bound column or parameter data, producing new addresses.  
  
 **block cursor**  
 A cursor capable of fetching more than one row of data at a time.  
  
 **buffer**  
 A piece of application memory used to pass data between the application and driver. Buffers often come in pairs: a *data buffer* and a *data length buffer*.  
  
 **byte**  
 Eight bits or one octet. *See also* octet.  
  
## C  
 **C data type**  
 The data type of a variable in a C program, in this case the application.  
  
 **catalog**  
 The set of system tables in a database that describe the shape of the database. Also known as a *schema* or *data dictionary*.  
  
 **catalog function**  
 An ODBC function used to retrieve information from the database's catalog.  
  
 **CLI**  
 *See* API.  
  
 **client/server**  
 A database access strategy in which one or more clients access data through a server. The clients usually implement the user interface while the server controls database access.  
  
 **column**  
 The container for a single item of information in a row. Also known as *field*.  
  
 **commit**  
 To make the changes in a transaction permanent.  
  
 **concurrency**  
 The ability of more than one transaction to access the same data at the same time.  
  
 **conformance level**  
 A discrete set of functionality supported by a driver or data source. ODBC defines API conformance levels and SQL conformance levels.  
  
 **connection**  
 A particular instance of a driver and data source.  
  
 **connection browsing**  
 Searching the network for data sources to connect to. Connection browsing might involve several steps. For example, the user might first browse the network for servers and then browse a particular server for a database.  
  
 **connection handle**  
 A handle to a data structure that contains information about a connection.  
  
 **current row**  
 The row currently pointed to by the cursor. Positioned operations act on the current row.  
  
 **cursor**  
 A piece of software that returns rows of data to the application. Probably named after the blinking cursor on a computer terminal; just as that cursor indicates the current position on the screen, a cursor on a result set indicates the current position in the result set.  
  
## D  
 **data buffer**  
 A buffer used to pass data. Often associated with a data buffer is a *data length buffer*.  
  
 **data dictionary**  
 *See* catalog.  
  
 **data length buffer**  
 A buffer used to pass the length of the value in a corresponding *data buffer*. The data length buffer is also used to store indicators, such as whether the data value is null-terminated.  
  
 **data source**  
 The data that the user wants to access and its associated operating system, DBMS, and network platform (if any).  
  
 **data type**  
 The type of a piece of data. ODBC defines C and SQL data types. *See also* type indicator.  
  
 **data-at-execution column**  
 A column for which data is sent after **SQLSetPos** is called. So named because the data is sent at execution time rather than being placed in a rowset buffer. Long data is generally sent in parts at execution time.  
  
 **data-at-execution parameter**  
 A parameter for which data is sent after **SQLExecute** or **SQLExecDirect** is called. So named because the data is sent when the SQL statement is executed rather than being placed in a parameter buffer. Long data is generally sent in parts at execution time.  
  
 **database**  
 A discrete collection of data in a DBMS. Also a DBMS.  
  
 **database engine**  
 The software in a DBMS that parses and executes SQL statements and accesses the physical data.  
  
 **DBMS**  
 Database Management System. A layer of software between the physical database and the user. The DBMS manages all access to the database.  
  
 **DBMS-based driver**  
 A driver that accesses physical data through a stand-alone database engine.  
  
 **DDL**  
 Data Definition Language. Those statements in SQL that define, as opposed to manipulate, data. For example, **CREATE TABLE**, **CREATE INDEX**, **GRANT**, and **REVOKE**.  
  
 **delimited identifier**  
 An identifier that is enclosed in identifier quote characters so that it can contain special characters or match keywords (also known as a quoted identifier).  
  
 **descriptor**  
 A data structure that holds information about either column data or dynamic parameters. The physical representation of the descriptor is not defined; applications gain direct access to a descriptor only by manipulating its fields by calling ODBC functions with the descriptor handle.  
  
 **desktop database**  
 A DBMS designed to run on a personal computer. Generally, these DBMSs do not provide a stand-alone database engine and must be accessed through a file-based driver. The engines in these drivers generally have reduced support for SQL and transactions. For example, dBASE, Paradox, Btrieve, or Microsoft® FoxPro®.  
  
 **diagnostic**  
 A record containing diagnostic information about the last function called that used a particular handle. Diagnostic records are associated with environment, connection, statement, and descriptor handles.  
  
 **DML**  
 Data Manipulation Language. Those statements in SQL that manipulate, as opposed to define, data. For example, **INSERT**, **UPDATE**, **DELETE**, and **SELECT**.  
  
 **driver**  
 A routine library that exposes the functions in the ODBC API. Drivers are specific to a single DBMS.  
  
 **Driver Manager**

 **transaction**  
 An atomic unit of work. The work in a transaction must be completed as a whole; if any part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction fails.  
  
 **transaction isolation**  
 The act of isolating one transaction from the effects of all other transactions.  
  
 **transaction isolation level**  
 A measure of how well a transaction is isolated. There are five transaction isolation levels: Read Uncommitted, Read Committed, Repeatable Read, Serializable, and Versioning.  
  
 **translator DLL**  
 A DLL used to translate data from one character set to another.  
  
 **translator setup DLL**  
 A DLL that contains translator-specific installation and configuration functions.  
  
 **two-phase commit**  
 The process of committing a distributed transaction in two phases. In the first phase, the transaction processor checks that all parts of the transaction can be committed. In the second phase, all parts of the transaction are committed. If any part of the transaction indicates in the first phase that it cannot be committed, the second phase does not occur. ODBC does not support two-phase commits.  
  
 **type indicator**  
 An integer value passed to or returned from an ODBC function to indicate the data type of an application variable, a parameter, or a column. ODBC defines type indicators for both C and SQL data types.  
  
## V  
 **view**  
 An alternative way of looking at the data in one or more tables. A view is usually created as a subset of the columns from one or more tables. In ODBC, views are generally equivalent to tables.
