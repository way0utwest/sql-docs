## Report Server Database Server Edition Requirements  
 When creating a report server database, not all editions of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] can be used to host the database. The following table shows you which editions of the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../includes/ssde-md.md)] you can use for specific editions of [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)].  
  
|For this edition of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Reporting Services|Use this edition of the Database Engine instance to host the database|  
|----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
|Enterprise|Enterprise,  or Standard  editions (local or remote)|  
|Standard|Enterprise,  or Standard  editions (local or remote)|  
|Web|Web edition (local only)|  
|Express with Advanced Services|Express with Advanced Services (local only).|  
|Evaluation|Evaluation|  
  
##  <a name="BIC"></a> Business Intelligence Clients  
 The following software client applications are available on the Microsoft Download center and are provided to assist you with creating business intelligence documents that run on a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instance. When you host these documents in a server environment, use an edition of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] that supports that document type. The following table identifies which [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] edition contains the server features required to host the documents created in these client applications.  
  
|Tool Name|Enterprise|Standard|Web|Express with Advanced Services|Express with Tools|Express|Developer|  
|---------------|----------------|--------------|---------|------------------------------------|------------------------|-------------|---------------|  
|[!INCLUDE[ssRBnoversion](../includes/ssrbnoversion-md.md)] (.rdl and .rds)|Yes|Yes|||||Yes|  
|[!INCLUDE[SS_MobileReptPub_Long](../includes/ss-mobilereptpub-long-md.md)] (.rsmobile)|Yes||||||Yes|  
|Power BI apps for mobile devices (iOS, Windows 10, Android) (.rsmobile)|Yes||||||Yes|  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> 1.  The above table identifies the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] editions that are required to enable these client tools; however these tools can access data hosted on any edition of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
> 2.  [!INCLUDE[SS_MobileReptPub_Long](../includes/ss-mobilereptpub-long-md.md)] is the single point for creation of mobile reports. Connect to  a [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] server to access data sources and create reports. Then publish them to the [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] server for others in the organization to access, either on the server or on mobile devices. You can also use [!INCLUDE[SS_MobileReptPub_Long](../includes/ss-mobilereptpub-long-md.md)] stand alone with local data sources  
> 3.  Whether you are using  [!INCLUDE[ssRSCurrent](../includes/ssrscurrent-md.md)] on-premises, [!INCLUDE[sspowerbi](../includes/sspowerbi-md.md)] in the cloud, or both as your report delivery solution you only need one mobile app to access dashboards and mobile reports on mobile devices. The [!INCLUDE[sspowerbi](../includes/sspowerbi-md.md)] apps are available for download from the Windows, iOS, or Android app stores.
