  Lists the IP addresses for the report server computer.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```vb  
Public Sub ListIPAddresses (ByRef IPAddress() as String, _  
    ByRef IPVersion()as String, ByRef IsDhcpEnabled () as Boolean, _   
    ByRef Length as Int32, ByRef HRESULT as Int32)  
```  
  
```csharp  
public void ListIPAddresses (out string[] IPAddress,   
    out string[] IPVersion, out bool[] isDhcpEnabled, out int length,   
    out int HRESULT);  
```  
  
## Parameters  
 *IPAddress[]*  
 [out] The list of IP address for the computer.  
  
 *IPVersion[]*

 *IsDhcpEnabled[]*  
 [out] Indicates whether the IP addresses are DHCP enabled.  
  
 *Length*

 *HRESULT*  
 [out] Value indicating whether the call succeeded or failed.  
  
## Return Value
