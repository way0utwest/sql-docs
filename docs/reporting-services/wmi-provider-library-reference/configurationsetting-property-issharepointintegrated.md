# ConfigurationSetting Property - IsSharePointIntegrated
  Specifies whether the report server is in SharePoint integrated mode. Beginning in [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../includes/sssql11-md.md)], this property always returns **False** because in SharePoint mode, [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] instances are SharePoint shared services and are not controlled by WMI providers.  
  
## Syntax

Public Dim IsSharePointIntegrated As Boolean  
```  
  
```csharp  
public Boolean IsSharePointIntegrated;  
```  
  
## Property Values
