# ConfigurationSetting Method - ListInstalledSharePointVersions
  Returns a set of tokens that represent the versions of Microsoft [!INCLUDE[winSPServ](../../includes/winspserv-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[offSPServ](../../includes/offspserv-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[SPF2010](../../includes/spf2010-md.md)], or [!INCLUDE[SPS2010](../../includes/sps2010-md.md)] that are installed on the same computer as the report server.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```vb  
Public Sub ListInstalledSharePointVersions(ByRef VersionTokens() _  
    As String, ByRef Length As Int32, ByRef HRESULT As Int32)  
```  
  
```csharp  
public void ListReportServersInDatabase (out string[] VersionTokens,   
    out Int32 Length, out Int32 HRESULT);  
```  
  
## Parameters  
 *VersionTokens[]*  
 [out] An array that contains the tokens that represent the version of a SharePoint product or technology that is compatible with the installed report server.  
  
 *Length*  
 [out] The length of the version tokens array.  
  
 *HRESULT*  
 [out] Value indicating whether the call succeeded or failed.  
  
## Return Value  
 Returns an *HRESULT* indicating success or failure of the method call. A value of 0 indicates that the method call was successful. A non-zero value indicates that an error has occurred.  
  
## Remarks  
 Each token that is returned represents a version of [!INCLUDE[winSPServ](../../includes/winspserv-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[SPF2010](../../includes/spf2010-md.md)] that is compatible with the currently installed report server. If a particular version of SharePoint is compatible with previous SharePoint versions, tokens for each compatible SharePoint version are returned.  
  
 The following is a table of the SharePoint tokens that are returned.
