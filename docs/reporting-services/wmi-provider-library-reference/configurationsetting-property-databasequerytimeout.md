## Syntax  
  
```vb  
Public Dim DatabaseQueryTimeout As UInt32  
```  
  
```csharp  
public UInt32 DatabaseQueryTimeout;  
```  
  
## Property Values  
 A 32-bit unsigned **integer** object that represents the number of seconds that the query is allowed to run.  
  
## Example Code
