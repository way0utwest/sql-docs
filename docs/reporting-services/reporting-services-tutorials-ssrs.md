# Reporting Services Tutorials (SSRS)

[!INCLUDE[ssrs-appliesto-sql2016-preview](../includes/ssrs-appliesto-sql2016-preview.md)]

Explore the capabilities of [!INCLUDE[ssRSCurrent_md](../includes/ssrscurrent-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull_md](../includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)], and Report Builder with sample data in these tutorials.  
  
  
## [Create a Basic Table Report](../reporting-services/create-a-basic-table-report-ssrs-tutorial.md)  
Follow the steps in this tutorial to learn how to create your first report. This tutorial shows you how to work with [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)] to create a data connection (data source), define a simple query (dataset), and configure a data region to contain your data.  
  
## [Create a Data-Driven Subscription](../reporting-services/create-a-data-driven-subscription-ssrs-tutorial.md)  
[!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] provides data-driven subscriptions so that you can customize the distribution of a report based on dynamic list of subscribers that will receive the report. Data-driven subscriptions are typically created and maintained by report server administrators. The ability to create data-driven subscriptions requires expertise in building queries, knowledge of data sources that contain subscriber data, and elevated permissions on a report server.  
   
## [Create a Drillthrough &#40;RDLC&#41; Report with Parameters using ReportViewer](../reporting-services/create-drillthrough-rdlc-report-with-parameters-reportviewer.md)

## [Report Builder Tutorials](../reporting-services/report-builder-tutorials.md)  
These tutorials introduce you a variety of visualizations you can create in Report Builder, such as maps and sparklines, as well as tutorials on how to use parameters and expressions.
