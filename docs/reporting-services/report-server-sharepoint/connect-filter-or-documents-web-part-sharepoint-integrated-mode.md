# Connect Filter or Documents web part with a Reporting Services Report Viewer web part

[!INCLUDE[ssrs-appliesto](../../includes/ssrs-appliesto.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssrs-appliesto-2016](../../includes/ssrs-appliesto-2016.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssrs-appliesto-sharepoint-2013-2016i](../../includes/ssrs-appliesto-sharepoint-2013-2016.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssrs-appliesto-not-pbirsi](../../includes/ssrs-appliesto-not-pbirs.md)]

[!INCLUDE [ssrs-previous-versions](../../includes/ssrs-previous-versions.md)]

If you are using a SharePoint product, you can create a dashboard or web part Page that includes a Filter web part or Documents web part and a Report Viewer web part. Supported versions are [!INCLUDE[SPF2010](../../includes/spf2010-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[SPS2010](../../includes/sps2010-md.md)]. Also supported are [!INCLUDE[winSPServ3](../../includes/winspserv3-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[offSPServ](../../includes/offspserv-md.md)] 2007. By connecting a Filter web part, users who select filter values in a Filter web part can send the value to a parameterized report on the same page. By connecting a Documents web part, users who click on reports in the Documents library can view the report in an adjacent Report Viewer web part.

> [!NOTE]
> Reporting Services integration with SharePoint is no longer available after SQL Server 2016.

 The Filter web part is used to send values to one or more parameters on a report. To use a Filter web part, the report must have parameters defined for it that are compatible with the values, data type, and format sent by the web part.  
  
 The Documents web part is associated with the Documents library of the Home site. To view, add, or remove items from the Documents library, click **View All Site Content**. In Libraries, click **Documents**. You can use the **New**, **Upload**, and **Actions** menu to manage the items in the Documents library.
