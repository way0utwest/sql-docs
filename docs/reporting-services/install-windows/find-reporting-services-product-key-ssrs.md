# How to find the product key for SQL Server 2017 Reporting Services

[!INCLUDE[ssrs-appliesto](../../includes/ssrs-appliesto.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssrs-appliesto-2017-and-later](../../includes/ssrs-appliesto-2017-and-later.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssrs-appliesto-not-pbirsi](../../includes/ssrs-appliesto-not-pbirs.md)]

Learn how to find your SQL Server 2017 Reporting Services (SSRS) product key so you can install your server in a production environment.

To find your product key, you start by downloading and running setup for SQL Server 2017.

1. Download SQL Server 2017 from one of these sources:

    - Volume Licensing Service Center
    - MSDN subscription
    - Retail (download from Microsoft Store)

1. Run SQL Server 2017 setup and copy the pre-populated key:

    ![Copy the SQL Server 2017 product key](media/find-reporting-services-product-key-ssrs/ssrs-ss2017-copy-product-key.png)

1. [Run Reporting Services setup](install-reporting-services.md) and paste the key:

     ![Paste the product key](media/find-reporting-services-product-key-ssrs/ssrs-ssrs2017-paste-product-key.png)

You should only have to do this step the first time you install SSRS 2017. Servicing updates shouldn't require you to enter the key.
