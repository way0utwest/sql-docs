# Mapping Source and Target Databases (AccessToSQL)
When you connect to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] or SQL Azure, you need to specify a target database for migration. If you have multiple Access databases you can map them to multiple [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] databases (or schemas) or to multiple schemas under the connected SQL Azure database.  
  
## SQL Server or SQL Azure Database Schemas  
[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] databases use the concept of schemas to separate objects within a database into logical groups. For example, a library database could use three schemas named **books**, **audio**, and **video** to separate book, audio, and video objects from each other. By default, the access database is mapped to **master** database and **dbo** schema in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] and to connected database and **dbo** schema in SQL Azure.  
  
Unless you customize the mapping between each Access database and the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] database and schema, SSMA will migrate all the schemas and data associated with the access database to the default database mapped.  
  
## Modifying the Target Database and Schema  
SSMA lets you map each Access database to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] or SQL Azure database and schema. The following procedure describes how to customize the mapping per database.  
  
**To modify the target database and schema**  
  
1.  In the Access Metadata Explorer pane, select **access-metadata**.  
  
    Schema mapping is also available when you select the **Databases** node or any database node. The schema mapping list is customized for the selected object.  
  
2.  In the right pane, click the **Schema Mapping** tab.  
  
    You will see a table containing access database names and its corresponding ssNoVersion or Sql Azure schema. The target schema is denoted in a two part notation (database.schema).  
  
3.  Select the row that contains the mapping you want to customize, and then click **Modify**.  
  
4.  In the **Choose Target Schema** dialog box, you may browse for available target database and schema or type the database and schema name in the textbox in a two part notation (database.schema) and then click **OK**.  
  
**Modes of Mapping**  
  
-   Mapping to SQL Server  
  
You can map source database to any target database. By default source database is mapped to target [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] database with which you have connected using SSMA. If the target database being mapped does not exist on [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)], then you will be prompted with a message **“The Database and/or schema does not exist in target [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] metadata. It would be created during synchronization. Do you wish to continue?”** Click Yes. Similarly, you can map schema to non-existing schema under target [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] database which will be created during synchronization.  
  
-   Mapping to SQL Azure  
  
You can map the source database to the connected target [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] database or to the any schema in the connected target [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] database. If you map source Schema to any non-existing schema under connected target database, then you will be prompted with a message **”Schema does not exist in target metadata. It would be created during synchronization. Do you wish to continue? ”** Click Yes.  
  
## Reverting to Your Initial Database and Schema  
If you customize the mapping between an Access database and a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] or SQL Azure database and schema, you can revert the mapping back to the database that you specified when you connected to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] or SQL Azure.  
  
**To reset to default database and schema**  
  
1.  Under the schema mapping tab, select any row and click **Reset to Default** to revert to the default database and schema.  
  
## Next Step  
The next step in the migration process is [converting database objects](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/e0ef67bf-80a6-4e6c-a82d-5d46e0623c6c)
