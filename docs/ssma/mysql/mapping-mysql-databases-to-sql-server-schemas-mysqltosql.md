# Mapping MySQL Databases to SQL Server Schemas (MySQLToSQL)
By default, SSMA for MySQL migrates all objects in a MySQL schema to a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] or SQL Azure database named for the schema. However, you can customize the mapping between MySQL schemas and [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] or SQL Azure databases.  
  
## MySQL and SQL Server or SQL Azure Schemas  
The MySQL concept of a schema maps to the SQL Server  concept of a database and one of its schemas. SSMA refers to the SQL Server combination of database and schema as a schema.  
  
The MySQL concept of a schema maps to the SQL Server concept of a database and one of its schemas. For example, MySQL might have a schema named **HR**. An instance of SQL Server might have a database named **HR**, and within that database are schemas. One schema is the **dbo** (or database owner) schema. By default, the MySQL schema **HR** will be mapped to the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] database and schema **HR.dbo**. SSMA refers to the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] combination of database and schema as a schema.  
  
You can modify the mapping between MySQL and [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] or Azure schemas.  
  
## Modifying the Target Database and Schema  
In SSMA, you can map a MySQL schema to any available [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] or SQL Azure schema.  
  
**To modify the database and schema**  
  
1.  In MySQL Metadata Explorer, select **Schemas**.  
  
    The **Schema Mapping** tab is also available when you select individual schemas. The list in the **Schema Mapping** tab is customized for the selected object.  
  
2.  In the right pane, click the **Schema Mapping** tab.  
  
    You will see a list of all MySQL schemas, followed by a target value. This target is denoted in a two part notation (*database.schema*) in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] or SQL Azure where your objects and data will be migrated.  
  
3.  Select the row that contains the mapping that you want to change, and then click **Modify**.  
  
    In the **Choose Target Schema** dialog box, you may browse for available target database and schema or type the database and schema name in the textbox in a two part notation (database.schema) and then click **OK**.  
  
4.  The target changes on the **Schema Mapping** tab.  
  
**Modes of Mapping**  
  
-   Mapping to SQL Server  
  
You can map source database to any target database. By default source database is mapped to target [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] database with which you have connected using SSMA. If the target database being mapped is non-existing on [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)], then you will be prompted with a message **“The Database and/or schema does not exist in target [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] metadata. It would be created during synchronization. Do you wish to continue?”** Click Yes. Similarly, you can map schema to non-existing schema under target [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] database which will be created during synchronization.  
  
-   Mapping to SQL Azure  
  
You can map the source database to the connected target [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] database or to the any schema in the connected target [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] database. If you map source Schema to any non-existing schema under connected target database, then you will be prompted with a message **”Schema does not exist in target metadata. It would be created during synchronization. Do you wish to continue? ”** Click Yes.  
  
## Reverting to the Default Database and Schema  
If you customize the mapping between a MySQL schema and a SQL Server schema, you can revert the mapping back to the default values.  
  
**To revert to the default database and schema**  
  
1.  Under the schema mapping tab, select any row and click **Reset to Default** to revert to the default database and schema.  
  
## Next Steps  
If you want to analyze the conversion of MySQL objects into SQL Server or SQL Azure objects, you can [create a conversion report](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/2a56a003-3b0f-453a-963c-00c9e40933ec) otherwise you can [Convert the MySQL database object definitions](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/ac21850b-fb32-4704-9985-5759b7c688c7) into SQL Server or SQL Azure schemas
