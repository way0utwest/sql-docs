# Monitor the Appliance by Using the Admin Console
The Admin Console is a SQL Server PDW web application that surfaces the appliance state, health, and performance information. Users connect to the Admin Console through Internet Explorer.

## <a name="Connect"></a>Connect to the Admin Console  
To connect to the Admin Console, requires:  
  
-   At least Internet Explorer version 10.  
  
-   Permissions to access the Admin Console. <!-- MISSING LINKS See [Grant Permissions to Use the Admin Console &#40;SQL Server PDW&#41;](../sqlpdw/grant-permissions-to-use-the-admin-console-sql-server-pdw.md).  -->  
  
-   The IP address of the Control node cluster.  Obtain this from your SQL Server PDW administrator.  
  
To connect to the Admin Console, use Internet Explorer and https to browse to the IP address of the Control node cluster. For example, if the IP address of the Control node cluster is `10.192.63.102`, enter `https://10.192.63.102` in your browser address bar. The first screen will request your **LOGIN** and **PASSWORD**. Provide either a SQL Server Authentication login and password, or a Windows Authentication login and Windows password. If using a Windows Authentication login, the Admin Console will use impersonation.
