# Appliance Monitoring
This Appliance Monitoring Guide describes the tools and tasks for monitoring the SQL Server PDW appliance.  
  
## <a name="Basics"></a>Monitoring Basics and Tools  
The values and information that can be monitored on the SQL Server PDW appliance are extensive. For example, the following are typical monitoring tasks.  
  
-   Check for any alert issued by SQL Server PDW.  
  
-   Monitor for failed hardware.  
  
-   Monitor for network connectivity problems.  
  
-   Check for errors returned to users during query processing.  
  
-   View the number of currently active sessions and queries.  
  
-   Check the status of loads, backups, and restores.  
  
### Appliance Monitoring Tools  
There are multiple tools available to monitor the appliance.  
  
Admin Console  
SQL Server PDW has an Admin Console. This is a web-based tool that displays information about queries, loads, backup and restore, locks, sessions, alerts, and appliance state. The Admin Console runs on the appliance; users connect to the Admin Console through Internet Explorer. For more information, see:  
  
-   [Monitor the Appliance by Using the Admin Console &#40;Analytics Platform System&#41;](monitor-the-appliance-by-using-the-admin-console.md)

System Views  
SQL Server PDW includes comprehensive system views that enable you to obtain detailed information about the appliance health, state, and performance. For a list of system views for monitoring tasks, see:  
  
-   [Monitor the Appliance by Using System Views &#40;Analytics Platform System&#41;](monitor-the-appliance-by-using-system-views.md)  
  
System Center Operations Manager (SCOM)  
SQL Server PDW has extensive integration with Systems Center Operations Manager. The management packs for SQL Server PDW are available as a free download. For more information about using System Center to monitor SQL Server PDW, see the following:  
  
-   [Monitor the Appliance by Using System Center Operations Manager &#40;Analytics Platform System&#41;](monitor-the-appliance-by-using-system-center-operations-manager.md)  
  
Custom Solutions  
For situations when System Center is not available with your data center monitoring tools, you can monitor the appliance by using a third-party monitoring solution. Installation of external software agents is currently not supported in PDW, but most monitoring solutions support Transact\-SQL integration, so the system administrator can implement direct Transact\-SQL queries against your PDW appliance.  
  
If your monitoring solution does not support direct Transact\-SQL queries, or you do not have a monitoring tool, then you can use scripts to perform monitoring tasks, such as sending email when an alert occurs.  The TechNet wiki contains a scripted monitoring solution example.
