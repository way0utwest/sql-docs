# Send Telemetry Feedback to Microsoft
Analytics Platform System has an optional telemetry feature that sends Admin Console data to Microsoft. We encourage you to enable this to help us improve the product.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> In this release, Microsoft is not actively monitoring the telemetry data. The data is being collected for analysis purposes only.  
  
## <a name="privacy"></a>Privacy  
To provide the maximum privacy protection, APS ships without enabling telemetry. Before enabling this feature, first review the [Microsoft Analytics Platform System Privacy Statement](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=400902). Then, to opt-in run the PowerShell script described below.  
  
## <a name="enable"></a>Enable Telemetry  
**DNS Forwarding:** Sending telemetry data to Microsoft requires Analytics Platform System to connect to the internet through a DNS forwarder. To enable this feature, you must enable DNS forwarding on all hosts and workload VMs. Invoke the `Enable-RemoteMonitoring` command with the `SetupDnsForwarder` option to properly configure DNS forwarding and enable telemetry. Invoke the `Enable-RemoteMonitoring` command without the `SetupDnsForwarder` option when DNS forwarding is already configured and you only want to enable Heartbeat Monitoring.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Enabling DNS forwarding opens the internet connection for all hosts and workload VMs.  
  
#### To Enable Feedback  
  
1.  Using an appliance domain administrator account, connect to the Control node (***appliance_domain*-CTL01**) and open a command prompt using your Windows administrator credentials.  
  
2.  Navigate to the following directory: `C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server Parallel Data Warehouse\100`.  
  
3.  Import the module `Configure-RemoteMonitoring.ps1`  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    > To import you must use two periods in the command.  
  
    **Example:**  
  
    ```  
    PS C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server Parallel Data Warehouse\100> . .\Configure-RemoteMonitoring.ps1  
    ```  
  
4.  Invoke the `Enable-RemoteMonitoring` command.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    > The script assumes that the internet connection is working properly and does not validate the internet connection.  
  
    1.  The first time you enable the telemetry, use the following command to ensure all DNS Forwarders are correctly configured. In this example replace the DNS Forwarded IP address `xx.xx.xx.xx` with the DNS Forwarder IP address in your environment.  
  
        ```  
        PS C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server Parallel Data Warehouse\100> Enable-RemoteMonitoring -SetupDnsForwarder -DnsForwarderIp xx.xx.xx.xx  
        ```  
  
    2.  When DNS forwarders are already configured, such as re-enabling previously disabled telemetry, use the following command to enable telemetry without configuring DNS Forwarding.  
  
        ```  
        PS C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server Parallel Data Warehouse\100> Enable-RemoteMonitoring  
        ```  
  
5.  You will be prompted to read and acknowledge that APS will collect information about the appliance. There will be a link to the APS privacy statement which you can copy and paste into any internet browser for review.  
  
6.  Enter **Y** to accept and opt in to feedback or enter **N** to not accept.  
  
7.  If you entered **Y** there will be a series of commands that will run which will enable the telemetry (and optionally the DNS Forwarder) feature on your appliance. If you see any errors or information that leads you to believe that the command was not successful contact CSS for assistance.  
  
If you entered **N**, no commands will be run and the feature will not be enabled and there is nothing more for you to do.  
  
There is no harm in running the `Enable-RemoteMonitoring` command multiple times. If the DNS forwarder is already set you will get a warning message indicating that is the case.  
  
## <a name="disable"></a>Disable Telemetry  
Disabling telemetry will stop all operations which communicate information about the state of the appliance to the APS monitoring service in the cloud.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Performing this operation will not disable your DNS forwarder or internet connection which may be in use by other features in the appliance.  
  
#### To Disable telemetry  
  
1.  Using an appliance domain administrator account, connect to the Control node (***appliance_domain*-CTL01**) and open a PowerShell window with administrator privileges.  
  
2.  Navigate to the following directory: `C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server Parallel Data Warehouse\100`.  
  
3.  Import the module `Configure-RemoteMonitoring.ps1`  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    > To import you must use two periods in the command.  
  
    **Example:**  
  
    ```  
    PS C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server Parallel Data Warehouse\100> . .\Configure-RemoteMonitoring.ps1  
    ```  
  
4.  Invoke the `Disable-RemoteMonitoring` command without parameters. This command will stop sending feedback. (This will not affect local monitoring.) However, the command will not disable the DNS Forwarder and/or disable any internet connectivity. This must be done manually after successfully disabling feedback.  
  
    **Example:**  
  
    ```  
    PS C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server Parallel Data Warehouse\100> Disable-RemoteMonitoring  
    ```  
  
If you see any errors or information that leads you to believe that the command was not successful contact CSS for assistance.  
  
There is no harm in running the `Disable-RemoteMonitoring` command multiple times.
