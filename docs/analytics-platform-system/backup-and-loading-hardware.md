# Backup and loading hardware overview
To deploy your end-to-end data warehousing solution on Analytics Platform System (APS) with SQL Server Parallel Data Warehouse (PDW), you need to create a plan for backing up the data warehouse and loading data. Use this guidance to acquire and configure backup and loading servers that will meet your business requirements.

To backup a PDW database, you need one or more backup servers. You can use your own existing hardware or purchase new hardware. For more information, see [Acquire and Configure a Backup Server](acquire-and-configure-backup-server.md). These instructions include a [Backup server capacity planning worksheet](backup-capacity-planning-worksheet.md) to help you plan the right solution for backup.  
  
## Acquire and configure loading servers

To load data, you need one or more loading servers. You can use your own existing ETL or other servers, or you can purchase new servers. For more information, see [Acquire and configure a loading server](acquire-and-configure-loading-server.md). These instructions include a [Loading server capacity planning worksheet](loading-server-capacity-planning-worksheet.md) to help you plan the right solution for loading.
