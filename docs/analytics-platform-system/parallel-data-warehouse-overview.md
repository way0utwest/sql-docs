## <a name="sec1"></a>Appliance Software – Query Processing and User Data Storage  
  
### Control Node  
MPP Engine  
The MPP Engine is the brains of the Massively Parallel Processing (MPP) system. It does the following:  
  
-   Creates parallel query plans and coordinates parallel query execution on the Compute nodes.  
  
-   Stores and coordinates metadata and configuration data for all of the databases.  
  
-   Manages SQL Server PDW database authentication and authorization.  
  
-   Tracks hardware and software status.  
  
### Data Movement Service (DMS)  
Data Movement Service (DMS) is part of the “secret sauce” of PDW. It does the following:  
  
-   Transfers data to and from the SQL Server PDW nodes.  
  
-   Processes query operations that require transferring data among the nodes.  
  
-   Improves query performance by optimizing data transfer speeds.  
  
### Admin Console  
The Admin Console is a web application that presents the appliance state, health, and performance information.  
  
### Configuration Manager  
The Configuration Manager (dwconfig.exe), is the tool that appliance administrators use to configure Analytics Platform System.  
  
### Control node databases  
SQL Server manages all of the databases on the Control node.  
  
-   The Shell database manages the metadata for all distributed user databases.  
  
-   TempDB contains the metadata for all user temporary tables across the appliance.  
  
-   Master is the master table for SQL Server on the Control node.  
  
### Compute Node  
The Compute nodes are parallel data processing and storage units. They have direct attached storage and use SQL Server to manage user data.  
  
### Data Movement Service (DMS)  
Data Movement Service (DMS) runs on each Compute node to do the following:  
  
-   As part of processing parallel queries, DMS transfer data to and from other Computer nodes and the Control node.  
  
-   DMS, running on each Compute node, receives data loads in parallel. Data is loaded in parallel directly from the loading server to the Compute nodes  
  
-   DMS transfers data from each Compute node directly to the backup server.  
  
-   Using PolyBase, DMS transfers data to and from an external Hadoop cluster, or the HDInsight Region on the appliance.  
  
### Compute node databases 
Each Compute node runs an instance of SQL Server to process queries and manage user data.  
  
## Appliance Fabric  
The appliance fabric provides the operating system, services, and network infrastructure for the appliance.  
  
### Domain Controller  
Active Directory (AD) Domain Services (DS)  
Analytics Platform System performs authentication among the Analytics Platform System nodes, and manages the authentication of SQL Server PDW Windows Authentication logins.  
  
DNS service  
Windows Domain Name Service (DNS) resolves domain names to IP addresses for the Analytics Platform System appliance.  
  
### Windows Deployment Service  
Windows Deployment Service (WDS) deploys the Windows Server operating system onto the appliance. It is deployed on every host and virtual machine across the appliance.  
  
The DHCP service creates IP addresses so that the hosts within the appliance domain can join the appliance network without having a pre-configured IP address.  
  
### Virtual Machine Manager  
Analytics Platform System uses virtualization to achieve high availability. The Virtual Machine Manager hosts System Center to deploy the operating system on the physical hosts.  
  
Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) to apply or remove Windows Updates across all of the hosts and virtual machines.  
  
### Windows Server  
All of the hosts and virtual machines in the appliance run Windows Server operating system.  
  
### Failover Clustering  
Windows Failover Clustering provides the ability to restart processes on a passive host in the event that a host fails.  
  
### Storage Spaces  
Windows Storage Spaces manages user data as a storage pool for a small group of Compute nodes. If a Compute node fails, the data is still accessible through another Compute node in the group.  
  
### Hyper-V  
Microsoft Hyper-V Server provides a simple and reliable virtualization solution. Analytics Platform System uses virtualizations to balance CPU resources and to provide high availability for the PDW nodes and appliance fabric components .  
  
## <a name="sec2"></a>Non-relational data
PolyBase technology to integrates SQL Server PDW data with external Hadoop data. The Hadoop data can be stored on any of these Hadoop Data sources:  
  
-   Hortonworks for Linux or Windows Server  
  
-   Cloudera on Linux  
  
-   HDInsight running on APS  
  
-   HDInsight data stored on Azure Storage Blob  
  
## Query Tools   
  
Queries are written with Transact\-SQL modified to fit the MPP nature of the queries. All queries are submitted to the Control node which generates a parallel query plan to run the query across the Compute nodes.  
  
### SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT)  
SQL Server Data Tools runs inside of Visual Studio and is our recommended GUI tool for submitting queries to SQL Server PDW. It is similar to SQL Server Management Studio by allowing you to navigate through an object explorer.  
  
If you don’t already have Visual Studio, you can download the tools that you need for free.
