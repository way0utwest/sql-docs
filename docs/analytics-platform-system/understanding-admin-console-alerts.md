# Understanding Admin Console Alerts
Alerts appear in the appliance **Admin Console** and in **System Center Operations Manager** (SCOM). Use this list of alerts to help identify which alerts require additional investigation.  
  
For information about connecting to the **Admin Console** by using Internet Explorer, see [Monitor the Appliance by Using the Admin Console &#40;Analytics Platform System&#41;](monitor-the-appliance-by-using-the-admin-console.md). For information about **SCOM**, see [Monitor the Appliance by Using System Center Operations Manager &#40;Analytics Platform System&#41;](monitor-the-appliance-by-using-system-center-operations-manager.md)  
  
For information about obtaining alert information by using Transact\-SQL, see [Monitor the Appliance by Using System Views &#40;Analytics Platform System&#41;](monitor-the-appliance-by-using-system-views.md).  
  
## Types of Alerts  
Alert names that indicate a NORMAL status do not usually require investigation. Alert names that contain the words NON_CRITICAL sometimes require action. Investigation is required for all other types of alerts.  
  
## Alert List  
Alerts are listed alphabetically by the **Alert Name**. All possible alerts are not in the list. The wording of some alerts varies slightly for different vendors.
