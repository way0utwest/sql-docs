# Microsoft SQL Server Samples
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-asdb-xxxx-xxx-md](../includes/appliesto-ss-asdb-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]
This gallery contains sample databases and other samples for Microsoft SQL products including SQL Server and Azure SQL Database.   

## New!! Wide World Importers sample database

We are pleased to feature a new sample database called Wide World Importers (WWI), developed to showcase database design using current features, tools and design techniques. The samples include an OLTP and an OLAP database which are built to run on SQL Server 2016 and later. 

## Documentation
The [WWI documentation](./world-wide-importers/wide-world-importers-documentation.md) is on Microsoft Docs.   
  

## SQL Server Samples repository
The code samples are located in the [Microsoft SQL Server Samples](https://github.com/microsoft/sql-server-samples) GitHub repository. Each sample includes a README file that explains how to run and use the sample.
