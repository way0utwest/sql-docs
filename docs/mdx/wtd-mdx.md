# Wtd (MDX)
[!INCLUDE[ssas-appliesto-sqlas](../includes/ssas-appliesto-sqlas.md)]

  Returns a set of sibling members from the same level as a given member, starting with the first sibling and ending with the given member, as constrained by the Week level in the Time dimension.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
Wtd( [ Member_Expression ] )  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 *Member_Expression*  
 A valid Multidimensional Expressions (MDX) expression that returns a member.  
  
## Remarks  
 If a member expression is not specified, the default is the current member of the first hierarchy with a level of type Weeks in the first dimension of type Time (**Time.CurrentMember**) in the measure group.  
  
 The **Wtd** function is a shortcut function for the [PeriodsToDate](../mdx/periodstodate-mdx.md) function where the level is set to *Weeks*. That is, `Wtd(Member_Expression)` is equivalent to `PeriodsToDate(Week_Level_Expression,Member_Expression)`.
