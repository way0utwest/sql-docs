## Is [!INCLUDE[name-sos](../includes/name-sos-short.md)] Open Source?

The source code for the front end of [!INCLUDE[name-sos](../includes/name-sos-short.md)] (which is based on Visual Studio Code) is available under a source code EULA that provides rights to modify and use the software, but not to redistribute it or host it in a cloud service. The source code for the data providers is available under the MIT license at [https://github.com/Microsoft/sqltoolsservice](https://github.com/Microsoft/sqltoolsservice).

## Do you plan to open source SSMS?

No. However, next generation multi-OS CLI and GUI tools are open source. For example, the mssql extension for VS Code, mssql-scripter, and msql-CLI are all open source on GitHub. The source code for [!INCLUDE[name-sos](../includes/name-sos-short.md)] is available on GitHub.


## Now that there is [!INCLUDE[name-sos](../includes/name-sos-short.md)], does Microsoft plan to deprecate SSMS and SSDT?

No. Investments in flagship Windows tools (SSMS, SSDT, PowerShell) will continue in addition to the next generation of multi-OS and multi-DB CLI and GUI tools.
The goal is to offer customers the choice of using the tools they want on the platforms of their choice for their scenarios.


## [!INCLUDE[name-sos](../includes/name-sos-short.md)] is missing a feature that is in SSMS/SSDT. Will you add it?
It depends on the scenario & customer/business need. To help prioritize, file a suggestion on [GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/sqlopsstudio/issues).


## I understand [!INCLUDE[name-sos](../includes/name-sos-short.md)] and the mssql extension for VS Code are powered by a new *tools service* that uses SMO APIs under the covers. Is SMO available on Linux and macOS?

The SMO APIs are not yet available on Linux or macOS in a consumable way. We ported over a subset of the SMO APIs to .NET Core that we needed for [!INCLUDE[name-sos](../includes/name-sos-short.md)], and we plan to expand as part of the roadmap.
The SQL Tools Service is on GitHub: [https://github.com/Microsoft/sqltoolsservice](https://github.com/Microsoft/sqltoolsservice).


## Do you plan to port the DACFx APIs and/or sqlpackage.exe and/or SSDT to Linux and macOS?

It's on the longer-term roadmap. To help prioritize, file a suggestion on [GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/sqlopsstudio/issues).


## Will SQL PowerShell cmdlets be available on Linux and macOS?

SQL PowerShell is available today on the PowerShell gallery and you can use it on Windows to work with SQL Server running anywhere, including SQL on Linux. Offering the SQL PowerShell cmdlets on Linux & macOS is in the roadmap. To help prioritize, file a suggestion on [GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/sqlopsstudio/issues).
