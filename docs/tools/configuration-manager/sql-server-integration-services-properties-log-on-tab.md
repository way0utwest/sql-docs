# SQL Server Integration Services Properties (Log On Tab)
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]
  Use the **Log On** tab of the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] **Properties** dialog box to specify the account used by the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] service, and to start and stop the service.  
  
## Options  
 **Local System account**  
 Specify a local system account, which does not require a password. However, the local system account may restrict the service from interacting with other servers, depending on the privileges granted to the account.  
  
 **This account**  
 Specify a local or domain user account that uses [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] Windows Authentication. [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] recommends using a domain user account with minimal rights for services. For information about selecting an account, search Books Online for the topic, "Setting Up Windows Service Accounts."  
  
 **Account Name**  
 Specify the local or domain user account name.  
  
 **Password**  
 Type the password of the account.  
  
 **Confirm password**  
 Type the password of the account again.  
  
 **Start**  
 Start the service.  
  
 **Stop**  
 Stop the service.  
  
 **Pause**  
 Pause the service.  
  
 **Resume**  
 Resume a paused service.
