# SQL Server Services
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]
  This section contains F1 Help topics for the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Services dialog boxes in [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Configuration Manager.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  If you open **SQL Server Configuration Manager** on a node of a cluster that does not host the resources, the services show as stopped.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  If the nodes of the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Services do not populate with the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] services available on the computer, you may not have sufficient permissions to access Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI). To configure permissions on WMI, search Books Online for the topic, "How to: Configure WMI to Show Server Status in SQL Server Tools."
