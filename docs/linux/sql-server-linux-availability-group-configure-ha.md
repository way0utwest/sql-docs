# Configure Always On availability group for SQL Server on Linux

[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-sslinux-only](../includes/tsql-appliesto-sslinux-only.md)]

This article describes how to create a SQL Server Always on availability group for high availability on Linux. There are two configuration types for availability groups. A *high availability* configuration uses a cluster manager to provide business continuity. This configuration can also include read-scale replicas. This document explains how to create the availability group high availability configuration.

You can also create a *read-scale* availability group without a cluster manager. This configuration only provides read-only replicas for performance scale-out. It does not provide high availability. To create a read-scale availability group, see [Configure read-scale availability group for SQL Server on Linux](sql-server-linux-availability-group-configure-rs.md).

Configurations that guarantee high availability and data protection require either two or three synchronous commit replicas. With three synchronous replicas the availability group can automatically recovery even if one server is not available. For more information, see [High availability and data protection for availability group configurations](sql-server-linux-availability-group-ha.md). 

All servers must be either physical or virtual, and virtual servers must be on the same virtualization platform. This requirement is because the fencing agents are platform specific. See [Policies for Guest Clusters](https://access.redhat.com/articles/29440#guest_policies).

## Roadmap

The steps to create an availability group on Linux servers for high availability are different from the steps on a Windows Server failover cluster. The following list describes the high level steps: 

1. [Configure SQL Server on three cluster servers](sql-server-linux-setup.md).

   >[!IMPORTANT]
   >All three servers in the availability group need to be on the same platform - physical or virtual - because Linux high availability uses fencing agents to isolate resources on servers. The fencing agents are specific for each platform.

2. Create the availability group. This step is covered in this current article. 

3. Configure a cluster resource manager, like Pacemaker.
   
   The way to configure a cluster resource manager depends on the specific Linux distribution. See the following links for distribution specific instructions: 

   * [RHEL](sql-server-linux-availability-group-cluster-rhel.md)
   * [SUSE](sql-server-linux-availability-group-cluster-sles.md)
   * [Ubuntu](sql-server-linux-availability-group-cluster-ubuntu.md)

   >[!IMPORTANT]
   >Production environments require a fencing agent, like STONITH for high availability. The demonstrations in this documentation do not use fencing agents. The demonstrations are for testing and validation only. 
   
   >A Linux cluster uses fencing to return the cluster to a known state. The way to configure fencing depends on the distribution and the environment. Currently, fencing is not available in some cloud environments. For more information, see [Support Policies for RHEL High Availability Clusters - Virtualization Platforms](https://access.redhat.com/articles/29440).
   
   >For SLES, see [SUSE Linux Enterprise High Availability Extension](https://www.suse.com/documentation/sle-ha-12/singlehtml/book_sleha/book_sleha.html#cha.ha.fencing).

5. Add the availability group as a resource in the cluster.  

   The way to add the availability group as a resource in the cluster depends on the Linux distribution. See the following links for distribution specific instructions: 

   * [RHEL](sql-server-linux-availability-group-cluster-rhel.md#create-availability-group-resource)
   * [SLES](sql-server-linux-availability-group-cluster-sles.md#configure-the-cluster-resources-for-sql-server)
   * [Ubuntu](sql-server-linux-availability-group-cluster-ubuntu.md#create-availability-group-resource)

## Create the availability group

There are two supported availability group configurations for SQL Server on Linux.

- [Three synchronous replicas](sql-server-linux-availability-group-ha.md#threeSynch)

- [Two synchronous replicas](sql-server-linux-availability-group-ha.md#twoSynch)

For information, see [High availability and data protection for availability group configurations](sql-server-linux-availability-group-ha.md).

Create the availability group for high availability on Linux. Use the [CREATE AVAILABILITY GROUP](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/statements/create-availability-group-transact-sql) with `CLUSTER_TYPE = EXTERNAL`. 

* Availability group - `CLUSTER_TYPE = EXTERNAL` 
   Specifies that an external cluster entity manages the availability group. Pacemaker is an example of an external cluster entity. When the availability group cluster type is external, 

* Set Primary and secondary replicas `FAILOVER_MODE = EXTERNAL`. 
   Specifies that the replica interacts with an external cluster manager, like Pacemaker. 

The following Transact-SQL scripts creates an availability group for high availability named `ag1`. The script configures the availability group replicas with `SEEDING_MODE = AUTOMATIC`. This setting causes SQL Server to automatically create the database on each secondary server. Update the following script for your environment. Replace the  `**<node1>**`, `**<node2>**`, or `**<node3>**` values with the names of the SQL Server instances that host the replicas. Replace the `**<5022>**` with the port you set for the data mirroring endpoint. To create the availability group, run the following Transact-SQL on the SQL Server instance that hosts the primary replica.

Run **only one** of the following scripts: 

- [Create availability group with three synchronous replicas](#threeSynch).
- [Create availability group with two synchronous replicas and a configuration replica](#configOnly)
- [Create availability group with three synchronous replicas](#readScale).

- Create availability group with three synchronous replicas

   ```SQL
   CREATE AVAILABILITY GROUP [ag1]
       WITH (DB_FAILOVER = ON, CLUSTER_TYPE = EXTERNAL)
       FOR REPLICA ON
           N'**<node1>**' 
   	      	WITH (
		       ENDPOINT_URL = N'tcp://**<node1>:**<5022>**',
		       AVAILABILITY_MODE = SYNCHRONOUS_COMMIT,
		       FAILOVER_MODE = EXTERNAL,
		       SEEDING_MODE = AUTOMATIC
		       ),
           N'**<node2>**' 
		    WITH ( 
		       ENDPOINT_URL = N'tcp://**<node2>**:**<5022>**', 
		       AVAILABILITY_MODE = SYNCHRONOUS_COMMIT,
		       FAILOVER_MODE = EXTERNAL,
		       SEEDING_MODE = AUTOMATIC
		       ),
		   N'**<node3>**'
           WITH( 
		      ENDPOINT_URL = N'tcp://**<node3>**:**<5022>**', 
		      AVAILABILITY_MODE = SYNCHRONOUS_COMMIT,
		      FAILOVER_MODE = EXTERNAL,
		      SEEDING_MODE = AUTOMATIC
		      );
   		
   ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP [ag1] GRANT CREATE ANY DATABASE;
   ```

   >[!IMPORTANT]
   >After you run the preceding script to create an availability group with three synchronous replicas, do not run the following script:

- Create availability group with two synchronous replicas and a configuration replica:

   >[!IMPORTANT]
   >This architecture allows any edition of SQL Server to host the third replica. For example, the third replica can be hosted on SQL Server Enterprise Edition. On Enterprise Edition, the only valid endpoint type is `WITNESS`. 

   ```SQL
   CREATE AVAILABILITY GROUP [ag1] 
      WITH (CLUSTER_TYPE = EXTERNAL) 
      FOR REPLICA ON 
       N'**<node1>**' WITH ( 
          ENDPOINT_URL = N'tcp://**<node1>**:**<5022>**', 
          AVAILABILITY_MODE = SYNCHRONOUS_COMMIT, 
          FAILOVER_MODE = EXTERNAL, 
          SEEDING_MODE = AUTOMATIC 
          ), 
       N'**<node2>**' WITH (  
          ENDPOINT_URL = N'tcp://**<node2>**:**<5022>**',  
          AVAILABILITY_MODE = SYNCHRONOUS_COMMIT, 
          FAILOVER_MODE = EXTERNAL, 
          SEEDING_MODE = AUTOMATIC 
          ), 
       N'**<node3>**' WITH ( 
          ENDPOINT_URL = N'tcp://**<node3>**:**<5022>**', 
          AVAILABILITY_MODE = CONFIGURATION_ONLY  
          );
   ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP [ag1] GRANT CREATE ANY DATABASE;
   ```
<a name="readScale"></a>

- Create availability group with two synchronous replicas

   Include two replicas with synchronous availability mode. For example, the following script creates an availability group called `ag1`. `node1` and `node2` host replicas in synchronous mode, with automatic seeding and automatic failover.

   >[!IMPORTANT]
   >Only run the following script to create an availability group with two synchronous replicas. Do not run the following script if you ran either preceding script. 

   ```SQL
   CREATE AVAILABILITY GROUP [ag1]
      WITH (CLUSTER_TYPE = EXTERNAL)
      FOR REPLICA ON
      N'node1' WITH (
         ENDPOINT_URL = N'tcp://node1:5022',
         AVAILABILITY_MODE = SYNCHRONOUS_COMMIT,
         FAILOVER_MODE = EXTERNAL,
         SEEDING_MODE = AUTOMATIC
      ),
      N'node2' WITH ( 
         ENDPOINT_URL = N'tcp://node2:5022', 
         AVAILABILITY_MODE = SYNCHRONOUS_COMMIT,
         FAILOVER_MODE = EXTERNAL,
         SEEDING_MODE = AUTOMATIC
      );
   		
   ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP [ag1] GRANT CREATE ANY DATABASE;
   ```


You can also configure an availability group with `CLUSTER_TYPE=EXTERNAL` using SQL Server Management Studio or PowerShell. 

### Join secondary replicas to the availability group

The following Transact-SQL script joins a SQL Server instance to an availability group named `ag1`. Update the script for your environment. On each SQL Server instance that hosts a secondary replica, run the following Transact-SQL to join the availability group.

```Transact-SQL
ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP [ag1] JOIN WITH (CLUSTER_TYPE = EXTERNAL);
		 
ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP [ag1] GRANT CREATE ANY DATABASE;
```

[!INCLUDE [Create Post](../includes/ss-linux-cluster-availability-group-create-post.md)]

>[!IMPORTANT]
>After you create the availability group, you must configure integration with a cluster technology like Pacemaker for high availability. For a read-scale configuration using availability groups, starting with [!INCLUDE [SQL Server version](..\includes\sssqlv14-md.md)], setting up a cluster is not required.

If you followed the steps in this document, you have an availability group that is not yet clustered. The next step is to add the cluster. This configuration is valid for read-scale/load balancing scenarios, it is not complete for high availability. For high availability, you need to add the availability group as a cluster resource. See [Next steps](#next-steps) for instructions. 

## Notes

>[!IMPORTANT]
>After you configure the cluster and add the availability group as a cluster resource, you cannot use Transact-SQL to fail over the availability group resources. SQL Server cluster resources on Linux are not coupled as tightly with the operating system as they are on a Windows Server Failover Cluster (WSFC). SQL Server service is not aware of the presence of the cluster. All orchestration is done through the cluster management tools. In RHEL or Ubuntu use `pcs`. In SLES use `crm`. 

>[!IMPORTANT]
>If the availability group is a cluster resource, there is a known issue in current release where forced failover with data loss to an asynchronous replica does not work. This will be fixed in the upcoming release. Manual or automatic failover to a synchronous replica succeeds.
