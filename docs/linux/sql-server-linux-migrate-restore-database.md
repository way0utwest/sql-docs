# Migrate a SQL Server database from Windows to Linux using backup and restore

[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-sslinux-only](../includes/tsql-appliesto-sslinux-only.md)]

SQL Server's backup and restore feature is the recommended way to migrate a database from SQL Server on Windows to SQL Server 2017 on Linux. In this tutorial, you will walk through the steps required to move a database to Linux with backup and restore techniques.

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create a backup file on Windows with SSMS
> * Install a Bash shell on Windows
> * Move the backup file to Linux from the Bash shell
> * Restore the backup file on Linux with Transact-SQL
> * Run a query to verify the migration

## Prerequisites

The following prerequisites are required to complete this tutorial:

* Windows machine with the following:
  * [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/sql-server/sql-server-2016-editions) installed.
  * [SQL Server Management Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms) installed.
  * Target database to migrate.

* Linux machine with the following installed:
  * SQL Server 2017 ([RHEL](quickstart-install-connect-red-hat.md), [SLES](quickstart-install-connect-suse.md), or [Ubuntu](quickstart-install-connect-ubuntu.md)) with command-line tools.

## Create a backup on Windows

There are several ways to create a backup file of a database on Windows. The following steps use SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).

1. Start **SQL Server Management Studio** on your Windows machine.

1. In the connection dialog, enter **localhost**.

1. In Object Explorer, expand **Databases**.

1. Right-click your target database, select **Tasks**, and then click **Back Up...**.

   ![Use SSMS to create a backup file](./media/sql-server-linux-migrate-restore-database/ssms-create-backup.png)

1. In the **Backup Up Database** dialog, verify that **Backup type** is **Full** and **Back up to** is **Disk**. Note name and location of the file. For example, a database named **YourDB** on SQL Server 2016 has a default backup path of `C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL13.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\Backup\YourDB.bak`.

1. Click **OK** to back up your database.

> [!NOTE]
> Another option is to run a Transact-SQL query to create the backup file. The following Transact-SQL command performs the same actions as the previous steps for a database called **YourDB**:
>
> ```sql
> BACKUP DATABASE [YourDB] TO  DISK =
> N'C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL13.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\Backup\YourDB.bak'
> WITH NOFORMAT, NOINIT, NAME = N'YourDB-Full Database Backup',
> SKIP, NOREWIND, NOUNLOAD, STATS = 10
> GO
> ```

## Install a Bash shell on Windows

To restore the database, you must first transfer the backup file from the Windows machine to the target Linux machine. In this tutorial, we move the file to Linux from a Bash shell (terminal window) running on Windows.

1. Install a Bash shell on your Windows machine that supports the **scp** (secure copy) and **ssh** (remote login) commands. Two examples include:

   * The [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://msdn.microsoft.com/commandline/wsl/about) (Windows 10)
   * The Git Bash Shell ([https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads))

1. Open a Bash session on Windows.

## <a id="scp"></a> Copy the backup file to Linux

1. In your Bash session, navigate to the directory containing your backup file. For example:

   ```bash
   cd 'C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL13.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\Backup\'
   ```

1. Use the **scp** command to transfer the file to the target Linux machine. The following example transfers **YourDB.bak** to the home directory of *user1* on the Linux server with an IP address of *192.0.2.9*:

   ```bash
   scp YourDB.bak user1@192.0.2.9:./
   ```
   ![scp command](./media/sql-server-linux-migrate-restore-database/scp-command.png)

> [!TIP]
> There are alternatives to using scp for file transfer. One is to use [Samba](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Samba) to configure an SMB network share between Windows and Linux. For a walkthrough on Ubuntu, see [How to Create a Network Share Via Samba](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/How%20to%20Create%20a%20Network%20Share%20Via%20Samba%20Via%20CLI%20%28Command-line%20interface/Linux%20Terminal%29%20-%20Uncomplicated,%20Simple%20and%20Brief%20Way!). Once established, you can access it as a network file share from Windows, such as **\\\\machinenameorip\\share**.

## Move the backup file before restoring

At this point, the backup file is on your Linux server in your user's home directory. Before restoring the database to SQL Server, you must place the backup in a subdirectory of **/var/opt/mssql**.

1. In the same Windows Bash session, connect remotely to your target Linux machine with **ssh**. The following example connects to the Linux machine **192.0.2.9** as user **user1**.

   ```bash
   ssh user1@192.0.2.9
   ```

   You are now running commands on the remote Linux server.

1. Enter super user mode.

   ```bash
   sudo su
   ```

1. Create a new backup directory. The -p parameter does nothing if the directory already exists.

   ```bash
   mkdir -p /var/opt/mssql/backup
   ```

1. Move the backup file to that directory. In the following example, the backup file resides in the home directory of *user1*. Change the command to match the location and file name of your backup file.

   ```bash
   mv /home/user1/YourDB.bak /var/opt/mssql/backup/
   ```

1. Exit super user mode.

   ```bash
   exit
   ```

## Restore your database on Linux

To restore the database backup, you can use the **RESTORE DATABASE** Transact-SQL (TQL) command.

> [!NOTE]
> The following steps use the **sqlcmd** tool. If you havenâ€™t install SQL Server Tools, see [Install SQL Server command-line tools on Linux](sql-server-linux-setup-tools.md).

1. In the same terminal, launch **sqlcmd**. The following example connects to the local SQL Server instance with the **SA** user. Enter the password when prompted, or specify the password by adding the **-P** parameter.

   ```bash
   sqlcmd -S localhost -U SA
   ```

1. At the `>1` prompt, enter the following **RESTORE DATABASE** command, pressing ENTER after each line (you cannot copy and paste the entire multi-line command at once). Replace all occurrences of `YourDB` with the name of your database.

   ```sql
   RESTORE DATABASE YourDB
   FROM DISK = '/var/opt/mssql/backup/YourDB.bak'
   WITH MOVE 'YourDB' TO '/var/opt/mssql/data/YourDB.mdf',
   MOVE 'YourDB_Log' TO '/var/opt/mssql/data/YourDB_Log.ldf'
   GO
   ```

   You should get a message the database is successfully restored.

1. Verify the restoration by listing all of the databases on the server. The restored database should be listed.

   ```sql
   SELECT Name FROM sys.Databases
   GO
   ```

1. Run other queries on your migrated database. The following command switches context to the **YourDB** database and selects rows from one of its tables.

   ```sql
   USE YourDB
   SELECT * FROM YourTable
   GO
   ```

1. When you are done using **sqlcmd**, type `exit`.

1. When you are done working in the remote **ssh** session, type `exit` again.
