# Editions and supported features of SQL Server 2017 on Linux

This article provides details of features supported by the various editions of SQL Server 2017 on Linux. For editions and supported features of SQL Server on Windows, see [SQL Server 2017 - Windows](../sql-server/editions-and-components-of-sql-server-2017.md).  
  
Installation requirements vary based on your application needs. The different editions of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] accommodate the unique performance, runtime, and price requirements of organizations and individuals. The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] components that you install also depend on your specific requirements. The following sections help you understand how to make the best choice among the editions and components available in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  

For the latest release notes and what's new information, see the following:
- [SQL Server on Linux release notes](sql-server-linux-release-notes.md)
- [What's new in SQL Server on Linux](sql-server-linux-whats-new.md)

For a list of SQL Server features not available on Linux, see [Unsupported features and services](sql-server-linux-release-notes.md#Unsupported).

## [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssNoVersion-md.md)] editions  
 The following table describes the editions of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. 
  
|[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] edition|Definition|  
|---------------------------------------|----------------|  
|Enterprise|The premium offering, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssNoVersion-md.md)] Enterprise edition delivers comprehensive high-end datacenter capabilities with blazing-fast performance enabling high service levels for mission-critical workloads.|  
|Standard|[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssNoVersion-md.md)] Standard edition delivers basic data management for departments and small organizations to run their applications and supports common development tools for on-premise and cloud â€” enabling effective database management with minimal IT resources.|  
|Web|[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssNoVersion-md.md)] Web edition is a low total-cost-of-ownership option for Web hosters and Web VAPs to provide scalability, affordability, and manageability capabilities for small to large scale Web properties.|  
|Developer|[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssNoVersion-md.md)] Developer edition lets developers build any kind of application on top of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. It includes all the functionality of Enterprise edition, but is licensed for use as a development and test system, not as a production server. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Developer is an ideal choice for people who build and test applications.|  
|Express edition|Express edition is the entry-level, free database and is ideal for learning and building desktop and small server data-driven applications. It is the best choice for independent software vendors, developers, and hobbyists building client applications. If you need more advanced database features, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Express can be seamlessly upgraded to other higher end versions of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].|  
  
## Using [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] with client/server applications  

You can install just the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] client components on a computer that is running client/server applications that connect directly to an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. A client components installation is also a good option if you administer an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] on a database server, or if you plan to develop [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] applications.  
  
## [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] components  

SQL Server 2017 on Linux supports the SQL Server database engine. The following table describes the features in the database engine.   
  
|Server components|Description|  
|-----------------------|-----------------|  
|[!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)]|[!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)] includes the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../includes/ssde-md.md)], the core service for storing, processing, and securing data, replication, full-text search, tools for managing relational and XML data, and in database analytics integration.|  

**Developer, Enterprise Core, and  Evaluation editions**  
For features supported by Developer, Enterprise Core, and Evaluation editions, see features listed for the SQL Server Enterprise edition in the tables below.

The Developer edition continues to support only 1 client for [SQL Server Distributed Replay](../tools/distributed-replay/sql-server-distributed-replay.md).
