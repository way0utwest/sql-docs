# Create and configure an availability group for SQL Server on Linux

[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-sslinux-only](../includes/tsql-appliesto-sslinux-only.md)]

This tutorial covers how to create and configure an availability group (AG) for [!INCLUDE[ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] on Linux. Unlike [!INCLUDE[sssql15-md](../includes/sssql15-md.md)] and earlier on Windows, you can enable AGs with or without creating the underlying Pacemaker cluster first. Integration with the cluster, if needed, is not done until later.
 
> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Enable availability groups.
> * Create availability group endpoints and certificates.
> * Use [!INCLUDE[ssmanstudiofull-md](../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] (SSMS) or Transact-SQL to create an availability group.
> * Create the [!INCLUDE[ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] login and permissions for Pacemaker.
> * Create availability group resources in a Pacemaker cluster (External type only).

## Prerequisite
- Deploy the Pacemaker high availability cluster as described in [Deploy a Pacemaker cluster for SQL Server on Linux](sql-server-linux-deploy-pacemaker-cluster.md).


## Enable the availability groups feature

Unlike on Windows, you cannot use PowerShell or [!INCLUDE[ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Configuration Manager to enable the availability groups (AG) feature. Under Linux, you must use `mssql-conf` to enable the feature. There are two ways to enable the availability groups feature: use the `mssql-conf` utility, or edit the `mssql.conf` file manually.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The AG feature must be enabled for configuration-only replicas, even on [!INCLUDE[ssexpress-md](../includes/ssexpress-md.md)].

### Use the mssql-conf utility

At a prompt, issue the following:

```bash
sudo /opt/mssql/bin/mssql-conf set hadr.hadrenabled 1
```

### Edit the mssql.conf file

You can also modify the `mssql.conf` file, located under the `/var/opt/mssql` folder, to add the following lines:

```
[hadr]

hadr.hadrenabled = 1
```

### Restart [!INCLUDE[ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]
After enabling availability groups, as on Windows, you must restart [!INCLUDE[ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. That can be done by the following:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart mssql-server
```

## Create the availability group endpoints and certificates

An availability group uses TCP endpoints for communication. Under Linux, endpoints for an AG are only supported if certificates are used for authentication. This means that the certificate from one instance must be restored on all other instances that will be replicas participating in the same AG. The certificate process is required even for a configuration-only replica. 

Creating endpoints and restoring certificates can only be done via Transact-SQL. You can use non-[!INCLUDE[ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]-generated certificates as well. You will also need a process to manage and replace any certificates that expire.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you plan to use the [!INCLUDE[ssmanstudiofull-md](../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] wizard to create the AG, you still need to create and restore the certificates by using Transact-SQL on Linux.

For full syntax on the options available for the various commands (such as additional security), consult:

-   [BACKUP CERTIFICATE](../t-sql/statements/backup-certificate-transact-sql.md)
-   [CREATE CERTIFICATE](../t-sql/statements/create-certificate-transact-sql.md)
-   [CREATE ENDPOINT](../t-sql/statements/create-endpoint-transact-sql.md)

> [!NOTE]
> Although you will be creating an availability group, the type of endpoint uses *FOR DATABASE_MIRRORING*, because some underlying aspects were once shared with that now-deprecated feature.

This example will create certificates for a three-node configuration. The instance names are LinAGN1, LinAGN2, and LinAGN3.

1.  Execute the following on LinAGN1 to create the master key, certificate, and endpoint, as well as back up the certificate. For this example, the typical TCP port of 5022 is used for the endpoint.
    
    ```SQL
    CREATE MASTER KEY ENCRYPTION BY PASSWORD = '<StrongPassword>';
    
    GO
    
    CREATE CERTIFICATE LinAGN1_Cert
    WITH SUBJECT = 'LinAGN1 AG Certificate';
    
    GO
    
    BACKUP CERTIFICATE LinAGN1_Cert
    TO FILE = '/var/opt/mssql/data/LinAGN1_Cert.cer';
    
    GO
    
    CREATE ENDPOINT AGEP
    STATE = STARTED
    AS TCP (
        LISTENER_PORT = 5022,
        LISTENER_IP = ALL)
    FOR DATABASE_MIRRORING (
        AUTHENTICATION = CERTIFICATE LinAGN1_Cert,
        ROLE = ALL);
    
    GO
    ```
    
2.  Do the same on LinAGN2:
    
    ```SQL
    CREATE MASTER KEY ENCRYPTION BY PASSWORD = '<StrongPassword>';
    
    GO
    
    CREATE CERTIFICATE LinAGN2_Cert
    WITH SUBJECT = 'LinAGN2 AG Certificate';
    
    GO
    
    BACKUP CERTIFICATE LinAGN2_Cert
    TO FILE = '/var/opt/mssql/data/LinAGN2_Cert.cer';
    
    GO
    
    CREATE ENDPOINT AGEP
    STATE = STARTED
    AS TCP (
        LISTENER_PORT = 5022,
        LISTENER_IP = ALL)
    FOR DATABASE_MIRRORING (
        AUTHENTICATION = CERTIFICATE LinAGN2_Cert,
        ROLE = ALL);
    
    GO
    ```
    
3.  Finally, perform the same sequence on LinAGN3:
    
    ```SQL
    CREATE MASTER KEY ENCRYPTION BY PASSWORD = '<StrongPassword>';
    
    GO
    
    CREATE CERTIFICATE LinAGN3_Cert
    WITH SUBJECT = 'LinAGN3 AG Certificate';
    
    GO
    
    BACKUP CERTIFICATE LinAGN3_Cert
    TO FILE = '/var/opt/mssql/data/LinAGN3_Cert.cer';
    
    GO
    
    CREATE ENDPOINT AGEP
    STATE = STARTED
    AS TCP (
        LISTENER_PORT = 5022,
        LISTENER_IP = ALL)
    FOR DATABASE_MIRRORING (
        AUTHENTICATION = CERTIFICATE LinAGN3_Cert,
        ROLE = ALL);
    
    GO
    ```
    
4.  Using `scp` or another utility, copy the backups of the certificate to each node that will be part of the AG.
    
    For this example:
    
    - Copy LinAGN1_Cert.cer to LinAGN2 and LinAGN3
    - Copy LinAGN2_Cert.cer to LinAGN1 and LinAGN3.
    - Copy LinAGN3_Cert.cer to LinAGN1 and LinAGN2.
    
5.  Change ownership and the group associated with the copied certificate files to `mssql`.
    
    ```bash
    sudo chown mssql:mssql <CertFileName>
    ```
    
6.  Create the instance-level logins and users associated with LinAGN2 and LinAGN3 on LinAGN1.
    
    ```SQL
    CREATE LOGIN LinAGN2_Login WITH PASSWORD = '<StrongPassword>';
    CREATE USER LinAGN2_User FOR LOGIN LinAGN2_Login;
    
    GO
    
    CREATE LOGIN LinAGN3_Login WITH PASSWORD = '<StrongPassword>';
    CREATE USER LinAGN3_User FOR LOGIN LinAGN3_Login;
    
    GO
    ```
    
7.  Restore LinAGN2_Cert and LinAGN3_Cert on LinAGN1. Having the other replicasâ€™ certificates is an important aspect of AG communication and security.
    
    ```SQL
    CREATE CERTIFICATE LinAGN2_Cert
    AUTHORIZATION LinAGN2_User
    FROM FILE = '/var/opt/mssql/data/LinAGN2_Cert.cer';
    
    GO
    
    CREATE CERTIFICATE LinAGN3_Cert
    AUTHORIZATION LinAGN3_User
    FROM FILE = '/var/opt/mssql/data/LinAGN3_Cert.cer';
    
    GO
    
8.  Grant the logins associated with LinAG2 and LinAGN3 permission to connect to the endpoint on LinAGN1.
    
    ```SQL
    GRANT CONNECT ON ENDPOINT::AGEP TO LinAGN2_Login;
    
    GO
    
    GRANT CONNECT ON ENDPOINT::AGEP TO LinAGN3_Login;
    
    GO
    ```
    
9.  Create the instance-level logins and users associated with LinAGN1 and LinAGN3 on LinAGN2.
    
    ```SQL
    CREATE LOGIN LinAGN1_Login WITH PASSWORD = '<StrongPassword>';
    CREATE USER LinAGN1_User FOR LOGIN LinAGN1_Login;
    
    GO
    
    CREATE LOGIN LinAGN3_Login WITH PASSWORD = '<StrongPassword>';
    CREATE USER LinAGN3_User FOR LOGIN LinAGN3_Login;
    
    GO
    ```
    
10.  Restore LinAGN1_Cert and LinAGN3_Cert on LinAGN2. 
    
    ```SQL
    CREATE CERTIFICATE LinAGN1_Cert
    AUTHORIZATION LinAGN1_User
    FROM FILE = '/var/opt/mssql/data/LinAGN1_Cert.cer';
    
    GO
    
    CREATE CERTIFICATE LinAGN3_Cert
    AUTHORIZATION LinAGN3_User
    FROM FILE = '/var/opt/mssql/data/LinAGN3_Cert.cer';
    
    GO
    
11.  Grant the logins associated with LinAG1 and LinAGN3 permission to connect to the endpoint on LinAGN2.
    
    ```SQL
    GRANT CONNECT ON ENDPOINT::AGEP TO LinAGN1_Login;
    
    GO
    
    GRANT CONNECT ON ENDPOINT::AGEP TO LinAGN3_Login;
    
    GO
    ```
    
12.  Create the instance-level logins and users associated with LinAGN1 and LinAGN2 on LinAGN3.
    
    ```SQL
    CREATE LOGIN LinAGN1_Login WITH PASSWORD = '<StrongPassword>';
    CREATE USER LinAGN1_User FOR LOGIN LinAGN1_Login;
    
    GO
    
    CREATE LOGIN LinAGN2_Login WITH PASSWORD = '<StrongPassword>';
    CREATE USER LinAGN2_User FOR LOGIN LinAGN2_Login;
    
    GO
    ```
    
13.  Restore LinAGN1_Cert and LinAGN2_Cert on LinAGN3. 
    
    ```SQL
    CREATE CERTIFICATE LinAGN1_Cert
    AUTHORIZATION LinAGN1_User
    FROM FILE = '/var/opt/mssql/data/LinAGN1_Cert.cer';
    
    GO
    
    CREATE CERTIFICATE LinAGN2_Cert
    AUTHORIZATION LinAGN2_User
    FROM FILE = '/var/opt/mssql/data/LinAGN2_Cert.cer';
    
    GO
    
14.  Grant the logins associated with LinAG1 and LinAGN2 permission to connect to the endpoint on LinAGN3.
    
    ```SQL
    GRANT CONNECT ON ENDPOINT::AGEP TO LinAGN1_Login;
    
    GO
    
    GRANT CONNECT ON ENDPOINT::AGEP TO LinAGN2_Login;
    
    GO
    ```

## Create the availability group

This section covers how to use [!INCLUDE[ssmanstudiofull-md](../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] (SSMS) or Transact-SQL to create the availability group for [!INCLUDE[ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].

### Use [!INCLUDE[ssmanstudiofull-md](../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)]

This section shows how to create an AG with a cluster type of External using SSMS with the New Availability Group Wizard.

1.  In SSMS, expand **Always On High Availability**, right click **Availability Groups**, and select **New Availability Group Wizard**.

2.  On the Introduction dialog, click **Next**.

3.  In the Specify Availability Group Options dialog, enter a name for the availability group and select a cluster type of EXTERNAL or NONE in the dropdown. External should be used when Pacemaker will be deployed. None is for specialized scenarios, such as read scale out. Selecting the option for database level health detection is optional. For more information on this option, see [Availability group database level health detection failover option](../database-engine/availability-groups/windows/sql-server-always-on-database-health-detection-failover-option.md). Click **Next**.

    ![](./media/sql-server-linux-create-availability-group/image3.png)

4.  In the Select Databases dialog, select the database(s) that will participate in the AG. Each database must have a full backup before it can be added to an AG. Click **Next**.

5.  In the Specify Replicas dialog, click **Add Replica**.

6.  In the Connect to Server dialog, enter the name of the Linux instance of [!INCLUDE[ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] that will be the secondary replica, and the credentials to connect. Click **Connect**.

7.  Repeat the previous two steps for the instance that will contain a configuration-only replica or another secondary replica.

8.  All three instances should now be listed on the Specify Replicas dialog. If using a cluster type of External, for the secondary replica that will be a true secondary, make sure the Availability Mode matches that of the primary replica and failover mode is set to External. For the configuration-only replica, select an availability mode of Configuration only.

    The following example shows an AG with two replicas, a cluster type of External, and a configuration-only replica.

    ![](./media/sql-server-linux-create-availability-group/image4.png)

    The following example shows an AG with two replicas, a cluster type of None, and a configuration-only replica.

    ![](./media/sql-server-linux-create-availability-group/image5.png)

9.  If you want to alter the backup preferences, click on the Backup Preferences tab. For more information on backup preferences with AGs, see [Configure backup on availability replicas](../database-engine/availability-groups/windows/configure-backup-on-availability-replicas-sql-server.md).

10. If using readable secondaries or creating an AG with a cluster type of None for read-scale, you can create a listener by selecting the Listener tab. A listener can also be added later. To create a listener, choose the option **Create an availability group listener** and enter a name, a TCP/IP port, and whether to use a static or automatically assigned DHCP IP address. Remember that for an AG with a cluster type of None, the IP should be static and set to the primaryâ€™s IP address.

    ![](./media/sql-server-linux-create-availability-group/image6.png)

11. If a listener is created for readable scenarios, SSMS 17.3 or later allows the creation of the read-only routing in the wizard. It can also be added later via SSMS or Transact-SQL. To add read-only routing now:

    a.  Select the Read-Only Routing tab.

    b.  Enter the URLs for the read-only replicas. These URLs are similar to the endpoints, except they use the port of the instance, not the endpoint.

    c.  Select each URL and from the bottom, select the readable replicas. To multi-select, hold down SHIFT or click-drag.

12. Click **Next**.

13. Choose how the secondary replica(s) will be initialized. The default is to use [automatic seeding](../database-engine/availability-groups/windows/automatically-initialize-always-on-availability-group.md), which requires the same path on all servers participating in the AG. You can also have the wizard do a backup, copy, and restore (the second option); have it join if you have manually backed up, copied, and restored the database on the replica(s) (third option); or add the database later (last option). As with certificates, if you are manually making backups and copying them, permissions on the backup files will need to be set on the other replica(s). Click **Next**.

14. On the Validation dialog, if everything does not come back as Success, investigate. Some warnings are acceptable and not fatal, such as if you do not create a listener. Click **Next**.

15. On the Summary dialog, click **Finish**. The process to create the AG will now begin.

16. When the AG creation is complete, click **Close** on the Results. You can now see the AG on the replicas in the dynamic management views as well as under the Always On High Availability folder in SSMS.

### Use Transact-SQL

This section shows examples of creating an AG using Transact-SQL. The listener and read-only routing can be configured after the AG is created. The AG itself can be modified with `ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP`, but changing the cluster type cannot be done in [!INCLUDE[sssql17-md](../includes/sssql17-md.md)]. If you did not mean to create an AG with a cluster type of External, you must delete it and recreate it with a cluster type of None. More information and other options can be found at the following links:

-   [CREATE AVAILABILITY GROUP (Transact-SQL)](../t-sql/statements/create-availability-group-transact-sql.md)
-   [ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP (Transact-SQL)](../t-sql/statements/alter-availability-group-transact-sql.md)
-   [Configure Read-Only Routing for an Availability Group (SQL Server)](../database-engine/availability-groups/windows/configure-read-only-routing-for-an-availability-group-sql-server.md)
-   [Create or Configure an Availability Group Listener (SQL Server)](../database-engine/availability-groups/windows/create-or-configure-an-availability-group-listener-sql-server.md)

#### Example One â€“ Two replicas with a configuration-only replica (External cluster type)

This example shows how to create a two-replica AG that uses a configuration-only replica.

1.  Execute on the node that will be the primary replica containing the fully read/write copy of the database(s). This example uses automatic seeding.

    ```SQL
    CREATE AVAILABILITY GROUP [<AGName>]
    WITH (CLUSTER_TYPE = EXTERNAL)
    FOR DATABASE <DBName>
    REPLICA ON N'LinAGN1' WITH (
       ENDPOINT_URL = N' TCP://LinAGN1.FullyQualified.Name:5022',
       FAILOVER_MODE = EXTERNAL,
       AVAILABILITY_MODE = SYNCHRONOUS_COMMIT),
    N'LinAGN2' WITH (
       ENDPOINT_URL = N'TCP://LinAGN2.FullyQualified.Name:5022',
       FAILOVER_MODE = EXTERNAL,
       AVAILABILITY_MODE = SYNCHRONOUS_COMMIT,
       SEEDING_MODE = AUTOMATIC),
    N'LinAGN3' WITH (
       ENDPOINT_URL = N'TCP://LinAGN3.FullyQualified.Name:5022',
       AVAILABILITY_MODE = CONFIGURATION_ONLY);
       
    GO
    ```
    
2.  In a query window connected to the other replica, execute the following to join the replica to the AG and initiate the seeding process from the primary to the secondary replica.
    
    ```SQL
    ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP [<AGName>] JOIN WITH (CLUSTER_TYPE = EXTERNAL);
    
    GO
    
    ALTER AVAILABLITY GROUP [<AGName>] GRANT CREATE ANY DATABASE;
    
    GO
    ```
    
3.  In a query window connected to the configuration only replica, join it to the AG.
    
   ```SQL
    ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP [<AGName>] JOIN WITH (CLUSTER_TYPE = EXTERNAL);
    
    GO
    ```

#### Example Two â€“ Three replicas with read-only routing (External cluster type)

This example shows three full replicas and how read-only routing can be configured as part of the initial AG creation.

1.  Execute on the node that will be the primary replica containing the fully read/write copy of the database(s). This example uses automatic seeding.

    ```SQL
    CREATE AVAILABILITY GROUP [<AGName>]
    WITH (CLUSTER_TYPE = EXTERNAL)
    FOR DATABASE <DBName>
    REPLICA ON N'LinAGN1'
    WITH (
       ENDPOINT_URL = N'TCP://LinAGN1.FullyQualified.Name:5022',
       FAILOVER_MODE = EXTERNAL,
       AVAILABILITY_MODE = SYNCHRONOUS_COMMIT,
       PRIMARY_ROLE (ALLOW_CONNECTIONS = READ_WRITE, READ_ONLY_ROUTING_LIST = (('LinAGN2.FullyQualified.Name', 'LinAGN3.FullyQualified.Name'))),
       SECONDARY_ROLE (ALLOW_CONNECTIONS = ALL, READ_ONLY_ROUTING_URL = N'TCP://LinAGN1.FullyQualified.Name:1433')),
    N'LinAGN2' WITH (
       ENDPOINT_URL = N'TCP://LinAGN2.FullyQualified.Name:5022',
       FAILOVER_MODE = EXTERNAL,
       SEEDING_MODE = AUTOMATIC,
       AVAILABILITY_MODE = SYNCHRONOUS_COMMIT,
       PRIMARY_ROLE (ALLOW_CONNECTIONS = READ_WRITE, READ_ONLY_ROUTING_LIST = (('LinAGN1.FullyQualified.Name', 'LinAGN3.FullyQualified.Name'))),
       SECONDARY_ROLE (ALLOW_CONNECTIONS = ALL, READ_ONLY_ROUTING_URL = N'TCP://LinAGN2.FullyQualified.Name:1433')),
    N'LinAGN3' WITH (
       ENDPOINT_URL = N'TCP://LinAGN3.FullyQualified.Name:5022',
       FAILOVER_MODE = EXTERNAL,
       SEEDING_MODE = AUTOMATIC,
       AVAILABILITY_MODE = SYNCHRONOUS_COMMIT,
       PRIMARY_ROLE (ALLOW_CONNECTIONS = READ_WRITE, READ_ONLY_ROUTING_LIST = (('LinAGN1.FullyQualified.Name', 'LinAGN2.FullyQualified.Name'))),
       SECONDARY_ROLE (ALLOW_CONNECTIONS = ALL, READ_ONLY_ROUTING_URL = N'TCP://LinAGN3.FullyQualified.Name:1433'))
    LISTENER '<ListenerName>' (WITH IP = ('<IPAddress>', '<SubnetMask>'), Port = 1433);
    
    GO
    ```
    
    A few things to note about this configuration:
    
    - *AGName* is the name of the availability group.
    - *DBName* is the name of the database that will be used with the availability group. It can also be a list of names separated by commas.
    - *ListenerName* is a name that is different than any of the underlying servers/nodes. It will be registered in DNS along with *IPAddress*.
    - *IPAddress* is an IP address that is associated with *ListenerName*. It is also unique and not the same as any of the servers/nodes. Applications and end users will use either *ListenerName* or *IPAddress* to connect to the AG.
    - *SubnetMask* is the subnet mask of *IPAddress*; for example, 255.255.255.0.

2.  In a query window connected to the other replica, execute the following to join the replica to the AG and initiate the seeding process from the primary to the secondary replica.
    
    ```SQL
    ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP [<AGName>] JOIN WITH (CLUSTER_TYPE = EXTERNAL);
    
    GO
    
    ALTER AVAILABLITY GROUP [<AGName>] GRANT CREATE ANY DATABASE;
    
    GO
    ```
    
3.  Repeat Step 2 for the third replica.

#### Example Three â€“ Two replicas with read-only routing (None cluster type)

This example shows the creation of a two-replica configuration using a cluster type of None. It is used for the read scale scenario where no failover is expected,. This creates the listener that is actually the primary replica, as well as the read-only routing, using the round robin functionality.

1.  Execute on the node that will be the primary replica containing the fully read/write copy of the database(s). This example uses automatic seeding.

    ```SQL
    CREATE AVAILABILITY GROUP [<AGName>]
    WITH (CLUSTER_TYPE = NONE)
    FOR DATABASE <DBName>
    REPLICA ON N'LinAGN1'
    WITH (
       ENDPOINT_URL = N'TCP://LinAGN1.FullyQualified.Name: <PortOfEndpoint>',
       FAILOVER_MODE = MANUAL,
       AVAILABILITY_MODE = ASYNCHRONOUS_COMMIT,
       PRIMARY_ROLE (ALLOW_CONNECTIONS = READ_WRITE, READ_ONLY_ROUTING_LIST = (('LinAGN1.FullyQualified.Name'.'LinAGN2.FullyQualified.Name'))),
       SECONDARY_ROLE (ALLOW_CONNECTIONS = ALL, READ_ONLY_ROUTING_URL = N'TCP://LinAGN1.FullyQualified.Name:<PortOfInstance>'));
    N'LinAGN2' WITH (
       ENDPOINT_URL = N'TCP://LinAGN2.FullyQualified.Name:<PortOfEndpoint>',
       FAILOVER_MODE = MANUAL,
       SEEDING_MODE = AUTOMATIC,
       AVAILABILITY_MODE = ASYNCHRONOUS_COMMIT,
       PRIMARY_ROLE (ALLOW_CONNECTIONS = READ_WRITE, READ_ONLY_ROUTING_LIST = (('LinAGN1.FullyQualified.Name', 'LinAGN2.FullyQualified.Name'))),
       SECONDARY_ROLE (ALLOW_CONNECTIONS = ALL, READ_ONLY_ROUTING_URL =N'TCP://LinAGN2.FullyQualified.Name:<PortOfInstance>'));
    LISTENER '<ListenerName>' (WITH IP = ('<PrimaryReplicaIPAddress>', '<SubnetMask>'), Port = <PortOfListener>);
    
    GO
    ```
    
    Where
    - *AGName* is the name of the availability group.
    - *DBName* is the name of the database that will be used with the availability group. It can also be a list of names separated by commas.
    - *PortOfEndpoint* is the port number used by the endpoint created.
    - *PortOfInstance* is the port number used by the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].
    - *ListenerName* is a name that is different than any of the underlying replicas but will not actually be used.
    - *PrimaryReplicaIPAddress* is the IP address of the primary replica.
    - *SubnetMask* is the subnet mask of *IPAddress*. For example, 255.255.255.0.
    
2.  Join the secondary replica to the AG and initiate automatic seeding.
    
    ```SQL
    ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP [<AGName>] JOIN WITH (CLUSTER_TYPE = NONE);
    
    GO
    
    ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP [<AGName>] GRANT CREATE ANY DATABASE;
    
    GO
    ```

## Create the [!INCLUDE[ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] login and permissions for Pacemaker

A Pacemaker high availability cluster underlying [!INCLUDE[ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] on Linux needs access to the [!INCLUDE[ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instance, as well as permissions on the availability group itself. These steps create the login and the associated permissions, along with a file that tells Pacemaker how to log into [!INCLUDE[ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].

1.  In a query window connected to the first replica, execute the following:

    ```SQL
    CREATE LOGIN PMLogin WITH PASSWORD '<StrongPassword>';
    
    GO
    
    GRANT VIEW SERVER STATE TO PMLogin;
    
    GO
    
    GRANT ALTER, CONTROL, VIEW DEFINITION ON AVAILABLITY GROUP::<AGThatWasCreated> TO PMLogin;
    
    GO
    ```
    
2.  On Node 1, enter the command 
    ```bash
    sudo emacs /var/opt/mssql/secrets/passwd
    ```
    
    This will open the Emacs editor.
    
3.  Enter the following two lines into the editor:

    ```
    PMLogin
    <StrongPassword>
    ```
    
4.  Hold down the CTRL key and then press X, then C, to exit and save the file.

5.  Execute 
    ```bash
    sudo chmod 400 /var/opt/mssql/secrets/passwd
    ```
    
    to lock down the file.

6.  Repeat Steps 1-5 on the other servers that will serve as replicas.

## Create the availability group resources in the Pacemaker cluster (External only)

After an availability group is created in [!INCLUDE[ssnoversion-md](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], the corresponding resources must be created in Pacemaker, when a cluster type of External is specified. There are two resources associated with an AG: the AG itself and an IP address. Configuring the IP address resource is optional if you are not using the listener functionality, but is recommended.

The AG resource that is created is a special kind of resource called a clone. The AG resource essentially has copies on each node, and there is one controlling resource called the master. The master is associated with the server hosting the primary replica. The secondary replicas (regular or configuration-only) are considered to be slaves and can be promoted to master in a failover.

1.  Create the AG resource with the following syntax:

    **Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and Ubuntu**
    
    ```bash
    sudo pcs resource create <NameForAGResource> ocf:mssql:ag ag_name=<AGName> --master meta notify=true
    ```

>[NOTE]
>On RHEL 7.4, you may encounter a warning with the use of --master. To avoid this, use the following syntax:
    ```bash
    sudo pcs resource create <NameForAGResource> ocf:mssql:ag ag_name=<AGName> master notify=true
    ```

    **SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES)**
    
    ```bash
    primitive <NameForAGResource> \
    ocf:mssql:ag \
    params ag_name="<AGName>" \
    op start timeout=60s \
    op stop timeout=60s \
    op promote timeout=60s \
    op demote timeout=10s \
    op monitor timeout=60s interval=10s \
    op monitor timeout=60s interval=11s role="Master" \
    op monitor timeout=60s interval=12s role="Slave" \
    op notify timeout=60s
    ms ms-ag_cluster <NameForAGResource> \
    meta master-max="1" master-node-max="1" clone-max="3" \
    clone-node-max="1" notify="true" \
    commit
    ```
    
    where *NameForAGResource* is the unique name given to this cluster resource for the AG, and *AGName* is the name of the AG that was created.
 
2.  Create the IP address resource for the AG that will be associated with the listener functionality.

    **RHEL and Ubuntu**
    
    ```bash
    sudo pcs resource create <NameForIPResource> ocf:heartbeat:IPaddr2 ip=<IPAddress> cidr_netmask=<Netmask>
    ```

    **SLES**
    
    ```bash
    crm configure \
    primitive <NameForIPResource> \
       ocf:heartbeat:IPaddr2 \
       params ip=<IPAddress> \
          cidr_netmask=<Netmask>
    ```
    
    where *NameForIPResource* is the unique name for the IP resource, and *IPAddress* is the static IP address assigned to the resource. On SLES, you also need to provide the netmask. For example, 255.255.255.0 would have a value of 24 for *Netmask.*
    
3.  To ensure that the IP address and the AG resource are running on the same node, a colocation constraint must be configured.

    **RHEL and Ubuntu**
    
    ```bash
    sudo pcs constraint colocation add <NameForIPResource> <NameForAGResource>-master INFINITY with-rsc-role=Master
    ```
   
    
    **SLES**
    
    ```bash
    crm configure <NameForConstraint> inf: \
    <NameForIPResource> <NameForAGResource>:Master 
    commit
    ```
    
    where *NameForIPResource* is the name for the IP resource, *NameForAGResource* is the name for the AG resource, and on SLES, *NameForConstraint* is the name for the constraint.

4.  Create an ordering constraint to ensure that the AG resource is up and running before the IP address. While the colocation constraint implies an ordering constraint, this enforces it.

    **RHEL and Ubuntu**
    
    ```bash
    sudo pcs constraint order promote <NameForAGResource>-master then start <NameForIPResource>
    ```
    
    **SLES**
    
    ```bash
    crm configure \
    order <NameForConstraint> inf: <NameForAGResource>:promote <NameForIPResource>:start
    commit
    ```
    
    where *NameForIPResource* is the name for the IP resource, *NameForAGResource* is the name for the AG resource, and on SLES, *NameForConstraint* is the name for the constraint.
