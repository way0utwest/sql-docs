# Configure SQL Server Integration Services on Linux with ssis-conf

You run the `ssis-conf` configuration script when you install SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Ubuntu. For more info about installing SSIS, see [Install SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) on Linux](sql-server-linux-setup-ssis.md).

You can also use the `ssis-conf` utility to configure the following properties:

| Command | Description |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| set-edition | Set the edition of SQL Server                                       |
| telemetry   | Enable or disable SQL Server Integration Services telemetry service |
| setup       | Initialize and set up Microsoft SQL Server Integration Services      |
|||

## Run ssis-conf

The examples in this article run `ssis-conf` by specifying the full path: `/opt/ssis/bin/ssis-conf`. If you navigate to that location before you run `ssis-conf`, you can run the utility in the context of the current directory: `./ssis-conf`.

Be sure to run the commands that are described in this article with root privileges. For example, run `sudo /opt/ssis/bin/ssis-conf setup` and not `/opt/ssis/bin/ssis-conf setup`.

To run these commands with prompts in the language that you prefer, you can specify a locale. For example, to receive prompts in Chinese, run the following command: `sudo LC_ALL=zh_CN.UTF-8 /opt/ssis/bin/ssis-conf setup`.

## Use set-edition to set the edition of SQL Server Integration Services

The edition of SSIS is aligned with the edition of SQL Server.

Enter the following command: `$ sudo /opt/ssis/bin/ssis-conf set-edition`.

After you enter the command, you'll receive the following prompt:

```
Choose an edition of SQL Server:

1) Evaluation (free, no production use rights, 180-day limit)

2) Developer (free, no production use rights)

3) Express (free)

4) Web (PAID)

5) Standard (PAID)

6) Enterprise (PAID)

7) Enterprise Core (PAID)

8) I bought a license through a retail sales channel and have a product key to enter.

Details about editions can be found at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=852748&clcid=0x409.

Use of PAID editions of this software requires separate licensing through a Microsoft Volume Licensing program.

By choosing a PAID edition, you are verifying that you have the appropriate number of licenses in place to install and run this software.

Enter your edition (1-8):
```

If you enter a value from 1 to 7, the system configures a free or PAID edition. If you enter 8, the utility prompts you to enter the product key that you bought:

```
Enter the 25-character product key:
```

## Use telemetry to configure customer feedback

The `telemetry` command determines whether SSIS sends feedback to Microsoft.

For free editions (that is, Express, Developer, and Evaluation editions), the telemetry service is always enabled. If you have a free edition, you canâ€™t use the `telemetry` command to disable telemetry.

Enter the following command: `$ sudo /opt/ssis/bin/ssis-conf telemetry`.

For PAID editions, after you enter the command, you'll receive the following prompt:

```
Send feature usage data to Microsoft. Feature usage data includes information about your hardware configuration and how you use SQL Server Integration Services.

[Yes/No]:
```

If you select **Yes**, the telemetry service is enabled and starts running. The service starts automatically after each boot. If you select **No**, the telemetry service stops and is disabled.

## Use setup to initialize and set up Microsoft SQL Server Integration Services

Use the `setup` command every time you install SSIS.

Enter the following command: `sudo /opt/ssis/bin/ssis-conf setup`.

The utility prompts you to acknowledge or provide values for the following items:
-   Product license
-   EULA agreement
-   Telemetry service
-   The language used by Integration Services

To run the `setup` command with prompts in the language that you prefer, you can specify a locale. For example, to receive prompts in Chinese, run the following command: `sudo LC_ALL=zh_CN.UTF-8 /opt/ssis/bin/ssis-conf setup`.

## ssis.conf format

The following `/var/opt/ssis/ssis.conf` file provides an example for each setting.

For SQL Server, you can change system settings by changing the values in the `mssql.conf` file. For SSIS, you *cannot* change system settings by changing the values in the `ssis.conf` file. The `ssis.conf` file shows only the results of the setup. If you want to change the settings for SSIS, you can delete the `ssis.conf` file and run the `setup` command again.

Here is a sample `ssis.conf` file. Each field corresponds to the result of one setup step.
