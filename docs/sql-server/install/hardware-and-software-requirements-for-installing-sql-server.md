# Hardware and Software Requirements for Installing SQL Server
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]
The topic lists the minimum hardware and software requirements to install and run [!INCLUDE[ssNoVer](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] on the Windows operating system. 

[!INCLUDE[sscurrent](../../includes/sssqlv14-md.md)] introduces support for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVer](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] on Linux. For information, see [Hardware and Software Requirements for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] on Linux](../../linux/sql-server-linux-setup.md#system). 

> This topic applies to [!INCLUDE[ss2016](../../includes/sssql15-md.md)] and later. For content related to previous versions of SQL Server, see [Hardware and Software Requirements for Installing SQL Server 2014](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms143506(v=sql.120).aspx). 
  
**Try it out:**  
  
-   Download SQL Server from the [**Evaluation Center**.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-sql-server-2016) 
  
-    Spin up a Virtual Machine with [**SQL Server 2016**](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/virtual-machines/sql-server/?wt.mc_id=sqL16_vm) already installed.  
  
 **The following considerations apply to all editions:**  
  
-   We recommend that you run [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] on computers with the NTFS or ReFS file formats. Installing [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] on a computer with FAT32 file system is supported but not recommended as it is less secure than the NTFS or ReFS file systems.  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Setup will block installations on read-only, mapped, or compressed drives.  
  
-   Installation fails if you launch setup through Remote Desktop Connection with the media on a local resource in the RDC client. To install remotely the media must be on a network share or local to the physical or virtual machine. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] installation media may be either on a network share, a mapped drive, a local drive, or presented as an ISO to a virtual machine.  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] installation requires installing  .NET 4.6.1 as a prerequisite. .NET 4.6.1 will be automatically installed by setup when [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] is selected.  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Setup installs the following software components required by the product:  
  
    -   [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client  
  
    -   [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Setup support files  
  
-   For minimum version requirements to install [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] on [!INCLUDE[win8srv](../../includes/win8srv-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[win8](../../includes/win8-md.md)], see [Installing SQL Server on Windows Server 2012 or Windows 8](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2681562) (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2681562).  
  
##  <a name="hwswr"></a> Hardware and Software Requirements  
The following requirements apply to all installations:  
  
|Component|Requirement|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|.NET Framework|[!INCLUDE[sql2016](../../includes/sssql15-md.md)] RC1 and later require [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] 4.6 for the Database Engine, Master Data Services, or  Replication. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] 2016 setup automatically installs [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)]. You can also manually install [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] from [Microsoft .NET Framework 4.6 (Web Installer) for Windows](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/3045560).<br/><br/> For more information, recommendations, and guidance about [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] 4.6 see [.NET Framework Deployment Guide for Developers](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ee942965\(v=vs.110\).aspx).<br/><br/>[!INCLUDE[winblue_client_2](../../includes/winblue-client-2-md.md)], and [!INCLUDE[winblue_server_2](../../includes/winblue-server-2-md.md)] require [KB2919355](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2919355) before installing [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] 4.6.|  
|Network Software|Supported operating systems for [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] have built-in network software. Named and default instances of a stand-alone installation support the following network protocols: Shared memory, Named Pipes, TCP/IP and VIA.<br/><br/> Note: Shared memory and VIA are not supported on failover clusters.<br/><br/> Also note that the VIA protocol is deprecated. [!INCLUDE[ssNoteDepFutureAvoid](../../includes/ssnotedepfutureavoid-md.md)]<br/><br/> <br/><br/> For more information about Network Protocols and Network Libraries, see [Network Protocols and Network Libraries](../../sql-server/install/network-protocols-and-network-libraries.md).|  
|Hard Disk|[!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] requires a minimum of 6 GB of available hard-disk space.<br/><br/> Disk space requirements will vary with the [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] components you install. For more information, see [Hard Disk Space Requirements](../../sql-server/install/hardware-and-software-requirements-for-installing-sql-server.md#HardDiskSpace) later in this topic. For information on supported storage types for data files, see [Storage Types for Data Files](../../sql-server/install/hardware-and-software-requirements-for-installing-sql-server.md#StorageTypes).|  
|Drive|A DVD drive, as appropriate, is required for installation from disc.|  
|Monitor|[!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] requires Super-VGA (800x600) or higher resolution monitor.|  
|Internet|Internet functionality requires Internet access (fees may apply).|  
  
 Note: Running [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] on a virtual machine will be slower than running natively because of the overhead of virtualization.  
  
 There are additional hardware and software requirements for the PolyBase feature. For more information, see [Get started with PolyBase](../../relational-databases/polybase/get-started-with-polybase.md).  
  
##  <a name="pmosr"></a> Processor, Memory, and Operating System Requirements  
 The following memory and processor requirements apply to all editions of [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]:  
  
|Component|Requirement|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|Memory *|**Minimum:**<br/><br/> Express Editions: 512 MB<br/><br/> All other editions: 1 GB<br/><br/> **Recommended:**<br/><br/> Express Editions: 1 GB<br/><br/> All other editions: At least 4 GB and should be increased as database size increases to ensure optimal performance.|  
|Processor Speed|**Minimum:** x64 Processor: 1.4 GHz<br/><br/> **Recommended:** 2.0 GHz or faster|  
|Processor Type|x64 Processor: AMD Opteron, AMD Athlon 64, Intel Xeon with Intel EM64T support, Intel Pentium IV with EM64T support|  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Installation of [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is supported on x64 processors only. It is no longer supported on x86 processors.  
  
 \* The minimum memory required for installing the [!INCLUDE[ssDQSServer](../../includes/ssdqsserver-md.md)] component in [!INCLUDE[ssDQSnoversion](../../includes/ssdqsnoversion-md.md)] (DQS) is 2 GB of RAM, which is different from the [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] minimum memory requirement. For information about installing DQS, see [Install Data Quality Services](../../data-quality-services/install-windows/install-data-quality-services.md).  
  
 **WOW64 Support:**  
  
 WOW64 (Windows 32-bit on Windows 64-bit) is a feature of 64-bit editions of Windows that enables 32-bit applications to run natively in 32-bit mode. Applications function in 32-bit mode, even though the underlying operating system is a 64-bit operating system. WOW64 is not supported for [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] installations. However, Management Tools are supported in WOW64.  
  
 **Operating System Support:**  
  
 The [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] editions are classified into the following:  
  
-   [Principal Editions](../../sql-server/install/hardware-and-software-requirements-for-installing-sql-server.md#TOP_Principal)  
  
-   [Breadth Editions](../../sql-server/install/hardware-and-software-requirements-for-installing-sql-server.md#TOP_Breadth)  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Exceptions to the operating system support noted in this section are the following Business Intelligence features for SQL Server 2016 and earlier, which can be installed on Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 or later:  
>  
>-   [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] - SharePoint  
> 
>-   [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)] Add-in for SharePoint products  
  
### Features Supported on 32-bit Client Operating Systems  
 Windows client operating systems, for example Windows 10 and Windows 8.1 are available as 32-bit or 64-bit architectures.   All SQL Server features are supported on 64-bit client operating systems. On supported 32-bit client operating systems Microsoft supports the following features:  
  
-   Data Quality Client  
  
-   Client Tools Connectivity  
  
-   Integration Services  
  
-   Client Tools Backwards Compatibility

\* Not supported for [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)].
  
##  <a name="CrossLanguageSupport"></a> Cross-Language Support  
 For more information about cross-language support and considerations for installing [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] in localized languages, see [Local Language Versions in SQL Server](../../sql-server/install/local-language-versions-in-sql-server.md).  
  
##  <a name="HardDiskSpace"></a> Hard Disk Space Requirements  
 During installation of [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], Windows Installer creates temporary files on the system drive. Before you run Setup to install or upgrade [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], verify that you have at least 6.0 GB of available disk space on the system drive for these files. This requirement applies even if you install [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] components to a non-default drive.  
  
 Actual hard disk space requirements depend on your system configuration and the features that you decide to install. The following table provides disk space requirements for [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] components.  
  
|**Feature**|**Disk space requirement**|  
|-----------------|--------------------------------|  
|[!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] and data files, Replication, Full-Text Search, and Data Quality Services|1480 MB|

##  <a name="StorageTypes"></a> Storage Types for Data Files  
 The supported storage types for data files are:  
  
-   Local Disk  
  
-   Shared Storage  

-   [Storage Spaces Direct \(S2D\)](https://technet.microsoft.com/windows-server-docs/storage/storage-spaces/storage-spaces-direct-overview)
  
-   SMB File Share  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  SMB storage is not supported for [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] data files for either standalone or clustered installations. Use direct attached storage, a storage area network, or S2D instead.  
  
    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    >  SMB storage can be hosted by a Windows File Server or a third party SMB storage device. If Windows File Server is used, the Windows File Server version should be 2008 or later. For more information about installing [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] using SMB file share as a storage option, see [Install SQL Server with SMB Fileshare as a Storage Option](../../database-engine/install-windows/install-sql-server-with-smb-fileshare-as-a-storage-option.md).  
  
    > [!WARNING]  
    >  [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] failover cluster installation supports Local Disk only for installing the tempdb files. Ensure that the path specified for the tempdb data and log files is valid on all the cluster nodes. During failover, if the tempdb directories are not available on the failover target node, the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] resource will fail to come online.  
  
##  <a name="DC_support"></a> Installing [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] on a Domain Controller  
 For security reasons, we recommend that you do not install [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] on a domain controller. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Setup will not block installation on a computer that is a domain controller, but the following limitations apply:  
  
-   You cannot run [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] services on a domain controller under a local service account.  
  
-   After [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is installed on a computer, you cannot change the computer from a domain member to a domain controller. You must uninstall [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] before you change the host computer to a domain controller.  
  
-   After [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is installed on a computer, you cannot change the computer from a domain controller to a domain member. You must uninstall [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] before you change the host computer to a domain member.  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] failover cluster instances are not supported where cluster nodes are domain controllers.  
  
- [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is not supported on a read-only domain controller. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Setup cannot create security groups or provision [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] service accounts on a read-only domain controller. In this scenario, Setup will fail.
