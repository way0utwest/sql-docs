# Setting the Data Source Properties
[!INCLUDE[Driver_JDBC_Download](../../includes/driver_jdbc_download.md)]

  Data sources are the preferred mechanism by which to create JDBC connections in a Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE) environment. Data sources provide connections, pooled connections, and distributed connections without hard-coding connection properties into Java code. All [!INCLUDE[jdbcNoVersion](../../includes/jdbcnoversion_md.md)] data sources can set or get the value of any property by using the appropriate setter and getter methods, respectively.  
  
 Java EE products, such as application servers and servlet/JSP engines, typically let you configure data sources for database access. Any property listed in the [Setting the Connection Properties](../../connect/jdbc/setting-the-connection-properties.md) topic can be specified wherever the configuration lets you enter a property as a property=value pair.  
  
 For more information about [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] data sources, see the [SQLServerDataSource](../../connect/jdbc/reference/sqlserverdatasource-class.md) class. For an example of how to use the SQLServerDataSource class to make a connection to a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] database, see [Data Source Sample](../../connect/jdbc/data-source-sample.md).
