# Sample JDBC Driver Applications
[!INCLUDE[Driver_JDBC_Download](../../includes/driver_jdbc_download.md)]

  The [!INCLUDE[jdbcNoVersion](../../includes/jdbcnoversion_md.md)] sample applications demonstrate various features of the JDBC driver. Additionally, they demonstrate good programming practices that you can follow when using the JDBC driver with a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] database.  
  
 All the sample applications are contained in *.java code files that can be compiled and run on your local computer, and they are located in various subfolders in the following location:  
  
 \<*installation directory*>\sqljdbc_\<*version*>\\<*language*>\samples  
  
 The topics in this section describe how to configure and run the sample applications, and include a discussion of what the sample applications demonstrate.  
  
## In This Section  
  
|Topic|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|[Connecting and Retrieving Data](../../connect/jdbc/connecting-and-retrieving-data.md)|These sample applications demonstrate how to connect to a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] database. They also demonstrate different ways in which to retrieve data from a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] database.|  
|[Working with Data Types &#40;JDBC&#41;](../../connect/jdbc/working-with-data-types-jdbc.md)|These sample applications demonstrate how to use the JDBC driver data type methods to work with data in a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] database.|  
|[Working with Result Sets](../../connect/jdbc/working-with-result-sets.md)|These sample applications demonstrate how to use result sets to process data contained in a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] database.|  
|[Working with Large Data](../../connect/jdbc/working-with-large-data.md)|These sample applications demonstrate how to use adaptive buffering to retrieve large-value data from a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] database without the overhead of server cursors.|
