# Using Connection Pooling
[!INCLUDE[Driver_JDBC_Download](../../includes/driver_jdbc_download.md)]

  The [!INCLUDE[jdbcNoVersion](../../includes/jdbcnoversion_md.md)] provides support for Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE) connection pooling. The JDBC driver implements the JDBC 3.0 required interfaces to enable the driver to participate in any connection-pooling implementation that is provided by middleware vendors and is JDBC 3.0-compliant. Middleware such as Java EE application servers frequently provides compliant connection-pooling facilities. The JDBC driver will participate in pooled connections in these environments.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Although the JDBC driver supports Java EE connection pooling, it does not provide its own pooling implementation. The driver relies on third-party Java Application Servers to manage the connections.  
  
## Remarks  
 The classes for the connection pooling implementation are as follows.  
  
|Class|Implements|Description|  
|-----------|----------------|-----------------|  
|com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc. SQLServerXADataSource|javax.sql.ConnectionPoolDataSource and javax.sql.XADataSource|We recommend that you use the [SQLServerXADataSource](../../connect/jdbc/reference/sqlserverxadatasource-class.md) class for all your Java EE server needs, because it implements all the JDBC 3.0 pooling and XA interfaces.|  
|com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc. SQLServerConnectionPoolDataSource|javax.sql.ConnectionPoolDataSource|This class is a connection factory that enables the Java EE application server to populate its connection pool with physical connections. If the configuration of your Java EE vendor requires a class that implements javax.sql.ConnectionPoolDataSource, specify the class name as [SQLServerConnectionPoolDataSource](../../connect/jdbc/reference/sqlserverconnectionpooldatasource-class.md). We generally recommend that you use the [SQLServerXADataSource](../../connect/jdbc/reference/sqlserverxadatasource-class.md) class instead, because it implements both pooling and XA interfaces, and has been verified in more Java EE server configurations.|  
  
 JDBC application code should always close connections explicitly to derive the most benefit from pooling. When the application explicitly closes a connection, the pooling implementation can reuse the connection immediately. If the connection is not closed, other applications cannot reuse it. Applications can use the `finally` construct to make sure that pooled connections are closed even if an exception occurs.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  The JDBC driver does not currently call the sp_reset_connection stored procedure when it returns the connection to the pool. Instead, the driver relies on third-party Java Application Servers to return the connections back to their original states.
