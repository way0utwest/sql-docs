# Using Database Metadata
[!INCLUDE[Driver_JDBC_Download](../../includes/driver_jdbc_download.md)]

  To query a database for information about what it supports, the [!INCLUDE[jdbcNoVersion](../../includes/jdbcnoversion_md.md)] implements the [SQLServerDatabaseMetaData](../../connect/jdbc/reference/sqlserverdatabasemetadata-class.md) class. This class contains numerous methods that return information in the form of a single value, or as a result set.  
  
 To create a SQLServerDatabaseMetaData object, you can use the [getMetaData](../../connect/jdbc/reference/getmetadata-method-sqlserverconnection.md) method of the [SQLServerConnection](../../connect/jdbc/reference/sqlserverconnection-class.md) class to get information about the database that it is connected to.  
  
 In the following example, an open connection to the [!INCLUDE[ssSampleDBnormal](../../includes/sssampledbnormal_md.md)] sample database is passed in to the function, the getMetaData method of the SQLServerConnection class is used to return a SQLServerDatabaseMetadata object, and then various methods of the SQLServerDatabaseMetaData object are used to display information about the driver, driver version, database name, and database version.
