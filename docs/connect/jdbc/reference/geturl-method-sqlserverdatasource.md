# getURL Method (SQLServerDataSource)
[!INCLUDE[Driver_JDBC_Download](../../../includes/driver_jdbc_download.md)]

  Returns the URL that is used to connect to the data source.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
public java.lang.String getURL()  
```  
  
## Return Value  
 A **String** that contains the URL.  
  
## Remarks  
 For security reasons, you should not include the password in the URL that is supplied to the [setURL](../../../connect/jdbc/reference/seturl-method-sqlserverdatasource.md) method. The reason for this is that third-party Java Application Servers will very often display the value set for the URL property in their data source configuration user interface. Instead, use the [setPassword](../../../connect/jdbc/reference/setpassword-method-sqlserverdatasource.md) method to set the password value. Java Application Servers will not display a password that is set in their data source in the configuration user interface.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  If the setURL method is not called before calling the getURL method, getURL returns the default value of "jdbc:sqlserver://".
