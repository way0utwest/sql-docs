# Homepage for client programming to Microsoft SQL Server


Welcome to our homepage about client programming to interact with Microsoft SQL Server, and with Azure SQL Database in the cloud. This article provides the following information:

- Lists and describes the available language and driver combinations.
    - Information is given for the operating systems of Linux (Ubuntu and others), MacOS, and Windows.
- Provides links to the detailed documentation for each combination.
- Displays the areas and subareas of the hierarchical documentation for certain languages, where appropriate.


#### Azure SQL Database

In any given language, the code that connects to SQL Server is almost identical to the code for connecting to Azure SQL Database.

For details about the connection strings for connecting to Azure SQL Database, see:

- [Use .NET Core (C#) to query an Azure SQL database](http://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-connect-query-dotnet-core).
- Other Azure SQL Database that are nearby the preceding article in the table of contents, about other languages. For instance, see [Use PHP to query an Azure SQL database](http://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-connect-query-php).


#### Build-an-app webpages

Our *Build-an-app* webpages present code examples, along with configuration information, in an alternative format. For more information, see later in this article the [section labeled *Build-an-app website*](#an-204-aka-ms-sqldev).

## ![C# logo][image-ref-320-csharp] C# using ADO.NET

The .NET managed languages, such as C# and Visual Basic, are the most common users of ADO.NET. *ADO.NET* is a casual name for a subset of .NET Framework classes.

## ![Entity Framework logo][image-ref-333-ef] Entity Framework (EF) with C&#x23;

Entity Framework (EF) provides Object-Relational Mapping (ORM). ORM makes it easier for your Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) source code to manipulate data that was retrieved from a relational SQL database.

EF has direct or indirect relationships with the following technologies:

- .NET Framework
- [LINQ to SQL](http://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/), or [LINQ to Entities](http://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/data/adonet/ef/language-reference/linq-to-entities)
- Language syntax enhancements, such as the **=>** operator in C#.
- Handy programs that generate source code for classes which map to the tables in your SQL database. For instance, [EdmGen.exe](http://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/data/adonet/ef/edm-generator-edmgen-exe).


#### Original EF, and new EF

The [start page for Entity Framework](http://docs.microsoft.com/ef/) introduces EF with a description similar to the following:

- Entity Framework is an object-relational mapper (O/RM) that enables .NET developers to work with a database using .NET objects. It eliminates the need for most of the data-access source code that developers usually need to write.

*Entity Framework* is a name shared by two separate source code branches. One EF branch is older, and its source code can now be maintained by the public. The other EF is new. The two EFs are described next:

|     |     |
| :-- | :-- |
| [EF 6.x](http://docs.microsoft.com/ef/ef6/) | Microsoft first released EF in August 2008. In March 2015 Microsoft announced that EF 6.x was the final version that Microsoft would develop. Microsoft released the source code into the public domain.<br /><br />Initially EF was part of .NET Framework. But EF 6.x was removed from .NET Framework.<br /><br />[EF 6.x source code on Github, in repository *aspnet/EntityFramework6*](http://github.com/aspnet/EntityFramework6) |
| [EF Core](http://docs.microsoft.com/ef/core/) | Microsoft released the newly developed EF Core in June 2016. EF Core is designed for better flexibility and portability. EF Core can run on operating systems beyond just Microsoft Windows. And EF Core can interact with databases beyond just Microsoft SQL Server and other relational databases.<br /><br />**C&#x23; code examples:**<br />[Getting Started with Entity Framework Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/ef/core/get-started/index)<br />[Getting started with EF Core on .NET Framework with an Existing Database](https://docs.microsoft.com/ef/core/get-started/full-dotnet/existing-db) |
| &nbsp; | <br /> |

EF and related technologies are powerful, and are a lot to learn for the developer who wants to master the entire area.

<a name="an-130-jdbc-docu" />

## ![Java logo][image-ref-330-java] Java and JDBC

Microsoft provides a Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) driver for use with SQL Server (or with Azure SQL Database, of course). It is a Type 4 JDBC driver, and it provides database connectivity through the standard JDBC application program interfaces (APIs).

<a name="an-140-node-js-docu" />

## ![Node.js logo][image-ref-340-node] Node.js

With Node.js you can connect to SQL Server from Windows, Linux, or Mac. The root of our Node.js documentation is [here](./node-js/index.md).

The Node.js connection driver for SQL Server is implemented in JavaScript. The driver uses the TDS protocol, which is supported by all modern versions of SQL Server. The driver is an open source project, [available on Github](http://tediousjs.github.io/tedious/).

## ODBC for C++ 

![ODBC logo][image-ref-350-odbc] ![cpp-big-plus][image-ref-322-cpp]

Open database connectivity (ODBC) was developed in the 1990s, and it predates .NET Framework. ODBC is designed to be independent of any particular database system, and independent of operating system.

Over the years numerous ODBC drivers have been created and released by groups within and outside of Microsoft. The range of drivers involve several client programming languages. The list of data targets goes well beyond SQL Server.

Some other connectivity drivers use ODBC internally.

#### Code example

- [C++ code example, using ODBC](../odbc/reference/sample-odbc-program.md)

#### Documentation outline

The ODBC content in this section focuses on accessing either SQL Server or Azure SQL Database, from C++. The following table lists an approximate outline of the major documentation for ODBC.

## [Build-an-app website, for SQL client development](http://www.microsoft.com/sql-server/developer-get-started/)


On our [*Build-an-app*](https://www.microsoft.com/sql-server/developer-get-started/) webpages you can choose from a long list of programming languages for connecting to SQL Server. And your client program can run a variety of operating systems.

*Build-an-app* emphasizes simplicity and completeness for the developer who is just getting started. The steps explain the following tasks:

1. How to install Microsoft SQL Server
2. How to download and install tools and drivers.
3. How to make any necessary configurations, as appropriate for your chosen operating system.
4. How to compile the provided source code.
5. How to run the program.

Next are a couple approximate outlines of the detail provided on the website:

#### Java on Ubuntu:

1. Set up your environment
    - Step 1.1 Install SQL Server
    - Step 1.2 Install Java
    - Step 1.3 Install the Java Development Kit (JDK)
    - Step 1.4 Install Maven
2. Create Java application with SQL Server
    - Step 2.1 Create a Java app that connects to SQL Server and executes queries
    - Step 2.2 Create a Java app that connects to SQL Server using the popular framework Hibernate
3. Make your Java app up to 100x faster
    - Step 3.1 Create a Java app to demonstrate Columnstore indexes

#### Python on Windows:

1. Set up your environment
    - Step 1.1 Install SQL Server
    - Step 1.2 Install Python
    - Step 1.3 Install the ODBC Driver and SQL Command Line Utility for SQL Server
2. Create Python application with SQL Server
    - Step 2.1 Install the Python driver for SQL Server
    - Step 2.2 Create a database for your application
    - Step 2.3 Create a Python app that connects to SQL Server and executes queries
3. Make your Python app up to 100x faster
    - Step 3.1 Create a new table with 5 million using sqlcmd
    - Step 3.2 Create a Python app that queries this table and measures the time taken
    - Step 3.3 Measure how long it takes to run the query
    - Step 3.4 Add a columnstore index to your table
    - Step 3.5 Measure how long it takes to run the query with a columnstore index

The following screenshots give you an idea of what our SQL development documentation website looks like.
