# Data Types with Stream Support Using the SQLSRV Driver
[!INCLUDE[Driver_PHP_Download](../../includes/driver_php_download.md)]

Retrieving data as a stream is only available in the SQLSRV driver of the [!INCLUDE[ssDriverPHP](../../includes/ssdriverphp_md.md)], and is not available in the PDO_SQLSRV driver.

-   binary  
  
-   char  
  
-   image  
  
-   nchar  
  
-   ntext  
  
-   nvarchar  
  
-   text  
  
-   UDT  
  
-   varbinary  
  
-   varchar  
  
-   XML
