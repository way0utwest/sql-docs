# Retrieving Data as a Stream Using the SQLSRV Driver
[!INCLUDE[Driver_PHP_Download](../../includes/driver_php_download.md)]

Retrieving data as a stream is only available in the SQLSRV driver of the [!INCLUDE[ssDriverPHP](../../includes/ssdriverphp_md.md)], and is not available in the PDO_SQLSRV driver.  
  
The [!INCLUDE[ssDriverPHP](../../includes/ssdriverphp_md.md)] takes advantage of streams for retrieving large amounts of data. The topics in this section provide details about how to retrieve data as a stream.  
  
The following steps summarize how to retrieve data as a stream:  
  
1.  Prepare and execute a Transact-SQL query with [sqlsrv_query](../../connect/php/sqlsrv-query.md) or the combination of [sqlsrv_prepare](../../connect/php/sqlsrv-prepare.md)/[sqlsrv_execute](../../connect/php/sqlsrv-execute.md).  
  
2.  Use [sqlsrv_fetch](../../connect/php/sqlsrv-fetch.md) to move to the next row in the result set.  
  
3.  Use [sqlsrv_get_field](../../connect/php/sqlsrv-get-field.md) to retrieve a field from the row. Specify that the data is to be retrieved as a stream by using **SQLSRV_PHPTYPE_STREAM(<encoding>)** as the third parameter in the function call. This table lists the constants used to specify encodings and their descriptions:  
  
    |SQLSRV Constant|Description|  
    |-------------------|---------------|  
    |SQLSRV_ENC_BINARY|Data is returned as a raw byte stream from the server without performing encoding or translation.|  
    |SQLSRV_ENC_CHAR|Data is returned in 8-bit characters as specified in the code page of the Windows locale set on the system. Any multi-byte characters or characters that do not map into this code page are substituted with a single byte question mark (?) character.|  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> Some data types are returned as streams by default. For more information, see [Default PHP Data Types](../../connect/php/default-php-data-types.md).
