# How to: Connect on a Specified Port
[!INCLUDE[Driver_PHP_Download](../../includes/driver_php_download.md)]

This topic describes how to connect to SQL Server on a specified port with the [!INCLUDE[ssDriverPHP](../../includes/ssdriverphp_md.md)].  
  
### To connect on a specified port  
  
1.  Verify the port on which the server is configured to accept connections. For information about configuring a server to accept connections on a specified port, see [How to: Configure a Server to Listen on a Specific TCP Port (SQL Server Configuration Manager)](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=121865).  
  
2.  Add the desired port to the *$serverName* parameter of the [sqlsrv_connect](../../connect/php/sqlsrv-connect.md) function. Separate the server name and the port with a comma. For example, the following lines of code use the SQLSRV driver to demonstrate how to connect to a server named *myServer* on port 1521:  
  
    ```  
    $serverName = "myServer, 1521";  
    sqlsrv_connect( $serverName );  
    ```  
  
    The following lines of code use the PDO_SQLSRV driver to demonstrate how to connect to a server named *myServer* on port 1521:  
  
    ```  
    $serverName = "(local), 1521";  
    $database = "AdventureWorks";  
    $conn = new PDO( "sqlsrv:server=$serverName;Database=$database", "", "");  
    ```
