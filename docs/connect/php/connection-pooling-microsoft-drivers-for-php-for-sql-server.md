# Connection Pooling (Microsoft Drivers for PHP for SQL Server)
[!INCLUDE[Driver_PHP_Download](../../includes/driver_php_download.md)]

The following are important points to note about connection pooling in the [!INCLUDE[ssDriverPHP](../../includes/ssdriverphp_md.md)]:  
  
-   The [!INCLUDE[ssDriverPHP](../../includes/ssdriverphp_md.md)] uses ODBC connection pooling.  
  
-   By default, connection pooling is enabled in Windows. In Linux and Mac OS X, connections are pooled only if connection pooling is enabled for ODBC. When connection pooling is enabled and you connect to a server, the driver attempts to use a pooled connection before it creates a new one. If an equivalent connection is not found in the pool, a new connection is created and added to the pool. The driver determines whether connections are equivalent based on a comparison of connection strings.  
  
-   When a connection from the pool is used, the connection state is reset.  
  
-   Closing the connection returns the connection to the pool.  
  
For more information about connection pooling, see [Driver Manager Connection Pooling](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=119622).  
  
## Enabling/Disabling connection pooling
### Windows
You can force the driver to create a new connection (instead of looking for an equivalent connection in the connection pool) by setting the value of the *ConnectionPooling* attribute in the connection string to **false** (or 0).  
  
If the *ConnectionPooling* attribute is omitted from the connection string or if it is set to **true** (or 1), the driver will only create a new connection if an equivalent connection does not exist in the connection pool.  
  
For information about other connection attributes, see [Connection Options](../../connect/php/connection-options.md).  
### Linux and Mac OS X
*ConnectionPooling* attribute cannot be used to enable/disable connection pooling. 

Connection pooling can be enabled/disabled by editing odbcinst.ini configuration file. The driver should be reloaded for the changes to take effect.

Setting `Pooling` to `Yes` and a positive `CPTimeout`value in odbcinst.ini enables connection pooling. 
```
[ODBC]
Pooling=Yes

[ODBC Driver 13 for SQL Server]
CPTimeout=<int value>
```
Setting `Pooling` to `No` in odbcinst.ini forces the driver to create a new connection.
```
[ODBC]
Pooling=No
```
