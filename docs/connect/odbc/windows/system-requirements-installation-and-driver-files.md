# System Requirements, Installation, and Driver Files
[!INCLUDE[Driver_ODBC_Download](../../../includes/driver_odbc_download.md)]

The ODBC Driver 11 for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] supports connections to SQL Server 2014, SQL Server 2012 R2, [!INCLUDE[ssKilimanjaro](../../../includes/sskilimanjaro_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../../includes/sskatmai_md.md)], and [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../../includes/ssversion2005_md.md)].  
  
The ODBC Driver 11 for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] on Windows can be installed on a computer that also has one or more versions of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] Native Client.  
  
The ODBC Driver 13 and 13.1 for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)], in addition to the above, supports SQL Server 2016.  
  
The driver name that you specify in a connection string is `ODBC Driver 11 for SQL Server` or `ODBC Driver 13 for SQL Server` (for both 13 and 13.1).
  
## Supported Operating Systems

You can run applications with the driver on the following Windows operating systems:  

-   Windows Server 2008 R2 
-   Windows Server 2012
-   Windows Server 2012 R2    
-   Windows Vista SP2  *(ODBC Driver 11 Only)*  
-   Windows 7  
-   Windows 8
-   Windows 8.1
-   Windows 10
  
## Installing Microsoft ODBC Driver for SQL Server

The driver is installed when you run `msodbcsql.msi` from [Download the Microsoft ODBC Driver 13.1 for SQL Server on Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=53339), [Download the Microsoft ODBC Driver 13 for SQL Server on Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=50420), or [Download the Microsoft ODBC Driver 11 for SQL Server on Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=36434). It can be installed side-by-side with [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] Native Client.  

When you invoke `msodbcsql.msi`, only the client components are installed by default. The client components are files that support running an application that was developed using the driver. To install the SDK components, specify `ADDLOCAL=ALL` on the command line. For example:  
  
```  
msiexec /i msodbcsql.msi ADDLOCAL=ALL  
```  
  
 Specify `IACCEPTMSODBCSQLLICENSETERMS=YES` to accept the terms of the end-user license if you use the `/passive`, `/qn`, `/qb`, or `/qr` option to install. This option must be specified in all uppercase letters. For example:  
  
```  
msiexec /quiet /passive /qn /i msodbcsql.msi IACCEPTMSODBCSQLLICENSETERMS=YES ADDLOCAL=ALL  
```  
  
 To do a silent uninstall:  
  
```  
msiexec /quiet /passive /qn /uninstall msodbcsql.msi  
```  
  
When an application uses the driver, the application should indicate that it depends on the driver through the install option `APPGUID`. Doing so enables the driver installer to report dependent applications before uninstalling. To specify a dependency on the driver, set the `APPGUID` command-line parameter to your product code when silently installing the driver. (A product code must be created when using Microsoft Installer to bundle your application setup program.) For example:  
  
```  
msiexec /i msodbcsql.msi APPGUID={ <Your dependent application's APPGUID> }  
```  

## Command-Line Tools: sqlcmd.exe and bcp.exe

The `bcp.exe` and `sqlcmd.exe` tools for use with the driver can be downloaded at [Microsoft Command Line Utilities 11 for SQL Server](http://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=36433), [Microsoft Command Line Utilities 13 for SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=52680), or [Microsoft Command Line Utilities 13.1 for SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=53591). The driver is a prerequisite to install `sqlcmd.exe` and `bcp.exe`.
  
`bcp.exe` and `sqlcmd.exe` are installed in the `110\Tools` subfolder of `%PROGRAMFILES%\Microsoft SQL Server\Client SDK\ODBC` for version 11, and `130\Tools` for 13 and 13.1.

An application that uses BCP functions must specify the driver from the same version which shipped with the header file and library used to compile the application.  

For example, when you compile an ODBC application with `msodbcsql11.lib` and `msodbcsql.h`, use "DRIVER={ODBC Driver 11 for SQL Server}" in the connection string.
