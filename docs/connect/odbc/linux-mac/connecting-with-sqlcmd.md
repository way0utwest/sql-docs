# Connecting with sqlcmd
[!INCLUDE[Driver_ODBC_Download](../../../includes/driver_odbc_download.md)]

The [sqlcmd](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=154481) utility is available in the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../../includes/msconame_md.md)] ODBC Driver for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] on Linux and macOS.
  
The following commands show how to use Windows Authentication (Kerberos) and [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] Authentication, respectively:
  
```  
sqlcmd –E –Sxxx.xxx.xxx.xxx  
sqlcmd –Sxxx.xxx.xxx.xxx –Uxxx -Pxxx  
```  
  
## Available Options

In the current release, the following options are available:  
  
- -? Display `sqlcmd` usage.  
  
- -a Request a packet size.  
  
- -b Terminate batch job if there is an error.  
  
- -c *batch_terminator* Specify the batch terminator.  
  
- -C Trust server certificate.  

- -d *database_name*  Issue a `USE `*database_name* statement when you start `sqlcmd`.  

- -D Causes the value passed to the `sqlcmd` -S option to be interpreted as a data source name (DSN). For more information, see "DSN Support in `sqlcmd` and `bcp`" at the end of this topic.  
  
- -e Write input scripts to the standard output device (stdout).

- -E Use trusted connection (integrated authentication.) For more information about making trusted connections that use integrated authentication from a Linux or macOS client, see [Using Integrated Authentication](../../../connect/odbc/linux-mac/using-integrated-authentication.md).

- -h *number_of_rows*  Specify the number of rows to print between the column headings.  
  
- -H Specify a workstation name.  
  
- -i *input_file*[,*input_file*[,…]] Identify the file that contains a batch of SQL statements or stored procedures.  
  
- -I  Set the `SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER` connection option to ON.  
  
- -k  Remove or replace control characters.  
  
- **-K***application_intent*  
Declares the application workload type when connecting to a server. The only currently supported value is **ReadOnly**. If **-K** is not specified, `sqlcmd` does not support connectivity to a secondary replica in an AlwaysOn availability group. For more information, see [ODBC Driver on Linux and macOS - High Availability and Disaster Recovery](../../../connect/odbc/linux-mac/odbc-driver-on-linux-support-for-high-availability-disaster-recovery.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> **-K** is not supported in the CTP for SUSE Linux. You can, however, specify the **ApplicationIntent=ReadOnly** keyword in a DSN file passed to `sqlcmd`. For more information, see "DSN Support in `sqlcmd` and `bcp`" at the end of this topic.  
  
- -l *timeout* Specify the number of seconds before a `sqlcmd` login times out when you try to connect to a server.

- -m *error_level* Control which error messages are sent to stdout.  
  
- **-M***multisubnet_failover*  
Always specify **-M** when connecting to the availability group listener of a [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../../includes/sssql11_md.md)] availability group or a [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../../includes/sssql11_md.md)] Failover Cluster Instance. **-M** provides for faster detection of failovers and connection to the (currently) active server. If **–M** is not specified, **-M** is off. For more information about [!INCLUDE[ssHADR](../../../includes/sshadr_md.md)], see [ODBC Driver on Linux and macOS - High Availability and Disaster Recovery](../../../connect/odbc/linux-mac/odbc-driver-on-linux-support-for-high-availability-disaster-recovery.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> **-M** is not supported in the CTP for SUSE Linux. You can, however, specify the **MultiSubnetFailover=Yes** keyword in a DSN file passed to `sqlcmd`. For more information, see "DSN Support in `sqlcmd` and `bcp`" at the end of this topic.  
  
- -N Encrypt connection.  
  
- -o *output_file* Identify the file that receives output from `sqlcmd`.  
  
- -p  Print performance statistics for every result set.  
  
- -P  Specify a user password.  
  
- -q *commandline_query*  Execute a query when `sqlcmd` starts, but does not exit when the query has finished running.  

- -Q *commandline_query*  Execute a query when `sqlcmd` starts. `sqlcmd` will exit when the query finishes.  

- -r Redirects error messages to stderr.

- -R Causes the driver to use client regional settings to convert currency and date and time data to character data. Currently only uses en_US (US English) formatting.
  
- -s *column_separator_char*  Specify the column-separator character.  

- -S [*protocol*:] *server*[**,***port*]  
Specify the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] to connect to, or if -D is used, a DSN. The ODBC driver on Linux and macOS requires -S. Note that **tcp** is the only valid protocol.  
  
- -t *query_timeout* Specify the number of seconds before a command (or SQL statement) times out.  
  
- -u Specify that output_file is stored in Unicode format, regardless of the format of input_file.  
  
- -U *login_id* Specify a user login ID.  
  
- -V *error_severity_level* Control the severity level that is used to set the ERRORLEVEL variable.  
  
- -w *column_width* Specify the screen width for output.  
  
- -W Remove trailing spaces from a column.  
  
- -x Disable variable substitution.  
  
- -X Disable commands, startup script, and environment variables.  
  
- -y *variable_length_type_display_width* Set the `sqlcmd` scripting variable `SQLCMDMAXFIXEDTYPEWIDTH`.
  
- -Y *fixed_length_type_display_width* Set the `sqlcmd` scripting variable `SQLCMDMAXVARTYPEWIDTH`.


## Available Commands

In the current release, the following commands are available:  
  
-   [:]!!  
  
-   :Connect  
  
-   :Error  
  
-   [:]EXIT  
  
-   GO [*count*]  
  
-   :Help  
  
-   :List  
  
-   :Listvar  
  
-   :On Error  
  
-   :Out  
  
-   :Perftrace  
  
-   [:]QUIT  
  
-   :r  
  
-   :RESET  
  
-   :setvar  
  
## Unavailable Options
In the current release, the following options are not available:  

- -A  Log in to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] with a Dedicated Administrator Connection (DAC). For information on how to make a dedicated administrator connection (DAC), see [Programming Guidelines](../../../connect/odbc/linux-mac/programming-guidelines.md).  
  
- -f *code_page* Specify the input and output code pages.  
  
- -L  List the locally configured server computers, and the names of the server computers that are broadcasting on the network.  
  
- -v  Create a `sqlcmd` scripting variable that can be used in a `sqlcmd` script.  
  
You can use the following alternative method: Put the parameters inside one file, which you can then append to another file. This will help you use a parameter file to replace the values. For example, create a file called `a.sql` (the parameter file) with the following content:
  
    :setvar ColumnName object_id  
    :setvar TableName sys.objects  
  
Then create a file called `b.sql`, with the parameters for replacement:  
  
    select $(ColumnName) from $(TableName)  

At the command line, combine `a.sql` and `b.sql` into `c.sql` using the following commands:  
  
    cat a.sql > c.sql 
  
    cat b.sql >> c.sql  
  
Run `sqlcmd` and use `c.sql` as input file:  
  
    slqcmd -S<…> -P<..> –U<..> -I c.sql  

- -z *password* Change password.  
  
- -Z *password* Change password and exit.  

## Unavailable Commands

In the current release, the following commands are not available:  
  
-   :ED  
  
-   :ServerList  
  
-   :XML  
  
## DSN Support in sqlcmd and bcp

You can specify a data source name (DSN) instead of a server name in the **sqlcmd** or **bcp** `-S` option (or **sqlcmd** :Connect command) if you specify -D. -D causes **sqlcmd** or **bcp** to connect to the server specified in the DSN by the -S option.  
  
System DSNs are stored in the `odbc.ini` file in the ODBC SysConfigDir directory (`/etc/odbc.ini` on standard installations). User DSNs are stored in `.odbc.ini` in a user's home directory (`~/.odbc.ini`).
  
The following entries are supported in a DSN on Linux or macOS:

-   **ApplicationIntent=ReadOnly**  

-   **Database=***database_name*  
  
-   **Driver=ODBC Driver 11 for SQL Server** or **Driver=ODBC Driver 13 for SQL Server**
  
-   **MultiSubnetFailover=Yes**  
  
-   **Server=***server_name_or_IP_address*  
  
-   **Trusted_Connection=yes**|**no**  
  
In a DSN, only the DRIVER entry is required, but to connect to a server, `sqlcmd` or `bcp` needs the value in the SERVER entry.  

If the same option is specified in both the DSN and the `sqlcmd` or `bcp` command line, the command line option overrides the value used in the DSN. For example, if the DSN has a DATABASE entry and the `sqlcmd` command line includes **-d**, the value passed to **-d** is used. If **Trusted_Connection=yes** is specified in the DSN, Kerberos authentication is used and user name (**–U**) and password (**–P**), if provided, are ignored.

Existing scripts that invoke `isql` can be modified to use `sqlcmd` by defining the following alias: `alias isql="sqlcmd –D"`.
