# STIsSimple (geometry Data Type)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2012-asdb-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2012-asdb-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

Returns 1 if a **geometry** instance is simple, as defined by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). Returns 0 if a **geometry** instance is not simple.
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
.STIsSimple ( )  
```  
  
## Return Types  
 [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] return type: **bit**  
  
 CLR return type: **SqlBoolean**  
  
## Remarks  
 To be simple, a **geometry** instance must meet all of the following requirements:  
  
-   Each figure of the instance must not intersect itself, except at its endpoints.  
  
-   No two figures of the instance can intersect each other at a point that is not in both of their boundaries.  
  
## Examples  
 The following example creates a nonsimple `LineString` instance that intersects itself and uses `STIsSimple()` to test whether the `LineString` is simple.  
  
```  
DECLARE @g geometry;  
SET @g = geometry::STGeomFromText('LINESTRING(0 0, 2 2, 0 2, 2 0)', 0);  
SELECT @g.STIsSimple();  
```
