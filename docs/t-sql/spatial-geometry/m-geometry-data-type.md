# M (geometry Data Type)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-asdb-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-asdb-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  The **M** (measure) value of the **geometry** instance. The semantics of the measure value are user-defined.  

## Syntax  
  
```  
  
.M  
```  
  
## Arguments  
  
## Return Types  
 [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] type: **float**  
  
 CLR type: **SqlDouble**  
  
## Remarks  
 The value of this property is null if the **geometry** instance is not a **Point**, as well as for any **Point** instance for which it is not set.  
  
 This property is read-only.  
  
 **M** values are not used in any calculations made by the library and will not be carried through any library calculations.  
  
## Examples  
 The following example creates a `Point` instance with Z (elevation) and M (measure) values and uses `M` to fetch the M value of the instance.  
  
```  
DECLARE @g geometry;  
SET @g = geometry::STGeomFromText('POINT(1 2 3 4)', 0);  
SELECT @g.M;  
```
