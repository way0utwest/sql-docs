# ToString (geography Data Type)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-asdb-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-asdb-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Returns the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Well-Known Text (WKT) representation of a **geography** instance augmented with any Z (elevation) and M (measure) values carried by the instance.  
  
 This geography data type method supports **FullGlobe** instances or spatial instances that are larger than a hemisphere.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
.ToString ()  
```  
  
## Return Types  
 [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] return type: **nvarchar(max)**  
  
 CLR return type: **SqlString**  
  
## Remarks  
 This method returns the string "Null" when called on null instances. In [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../includes/sssql11-md.md)], the set of possible results on the server has been extended to **FullGlobe** instances. This method will return the same value as `AsTextZM()`.  
  
 This method is not precise.  
  
## Examples  
 The following example create a `LineString` instance and uses `ToString()` to return the text description of the instance.  
  
```  
DECLARE @g geography;  
SET @g = geography::STGeomFromText('LINESTRING(-122.360 47.656, -122.343 47.656)', 4326);  
SELECT @g.ToString();  
```
