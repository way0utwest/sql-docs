# EnvelopeAggregate (geography Data Type)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2012-asdb-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2012-asdb-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

Returns a bounding object for a given set of **geography** objects. The resulting **geography** object contains multiple circular arc segments.
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
  
EnvelopeAggregate ( geography_operand )  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 *geography_operand*  
 Is a **geography** type table column that holds the set of **geography** objects on which to perform an envelope aggregate operation.  
  
## Return Types  
 [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] return type: **geography**  
  
## Remarks  
 A **FullGlobe** object is returned when the resulting bounding object is bigger than a hemisphere. This method is not precise.  
  
 Method returns **null** if the input has different SRIDs. See [Spatial Reference Identifiers &#40;SRIDs&#41;](../../relational-databases/spatial/spatial-reference-identifiers-srids.md).  
  
 Method ignores **null** inputs.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Method returns **null** if all inputted values are **null**.  
  
## Examples  
 The following example performs a `EnvelopeAggregate` on a set of **geography** location points within a city.  
  
 ```
 USE AdventureWorks2012  
 GO  
 SELECT City,  
 geography::EnvelopeAggregate(SpatialLocation) AS SpatialLocation  
 FROM Person.Address  
 WHERE PostalCode LIKE('981%')  
 GROUP BY City;
 ```
