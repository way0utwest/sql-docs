# MAX (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-all-md](../../includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-all-md.md)]

  Returns the maximum value in the expression.  
  
 ![Topic link icon](../../database-engine/configure-windows/media/topic-link.gif "Topic link icon") [Transact-SQL Syntax Conventions](../../t-sql/language-elements/transact-sql-syntax-conventions-transact-sql.md)  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
MAX ( [ ALL | DISTINCT ] expression )  
   OVER ( [ partition_by_clause ] order_by_clause )     
```  
  
## Arguments  
 **ALL**  
 Applies the aggregate function to all values. ALL is the default.  
  
 DISTINCT  
 Specifies that each unique value is considered. DISTINCT is not meaningful with MAX and is available for ISO compatibility only.  
  
 *expression*  
 Is a constant, column name, or function, and any combination of arithmetic, bitwise, and string operators. MAX can be used with **numeric**, **character**, **uniqueidentifier**, and **datetime** columns, but not with **bit** columns. Aggregate functions and subqueries are not permitted.  
  
 For more information, see [Expressions &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/language-elements/expressions-transact-sql.md).  
  
 OVER **(** [ *partition_by_clause* ] *order_by_clause***)**  
 *partition_by_clause* divides the result set produced by the FROM clause into partitions to which the function is applied. If not specified, the function treats all rows of the query result set as a single group. *order_by_clause* determines the logical order in which the operation is performed. *order_by_clause* is required. For more information, see [OVER Clause &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/queries/select-over-clause-transact-sql.md).  
  
## Return Types  
 Returns a value same as *expression*.  
  
## Remarks  
 MAX ignores any null values.  
  
 For character columns, MAX finds the highest value in the collating sequence.  
  
 MAX is a deterministic function when used without the OVER and ORDER BY clauses. It is nondeterministic when specified with the OVER and ORDER BY clauses. For more information, see [Deterministic and Nondeterministic Functions](../../relational-databases/user-defined-functions/deterministic-and-nondeterministic-functions.md).  
  
## Examples  
  
### A. Simple example  
 The following example returns the highest (maximum) tax rate in the [!INCLUDE[ssSampleDBnormal](../../includes/sssampledbnormal-md.md)] database.  
  
```sql  
SELECT MAX(TaxRate)  
FROM Sales.SalesTaxRate;  
GO  
```  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssResult](../../includes/ssresult-md.md)]  
  
 ```  
 -------------------  
 19.60  
 Warning, null value eliminated from aggregate.  
  
 (1 row(s) affected)  
 ```  
  
### B. Using the OVER clause  
 The following example uses the MIN, MAX, AVG, and COUNT functions with the OVER clause to provide aggregated values for each department in the `HumanResources.Department` table in the [!INCLUDE[ssSampleDBnormal](../../includes/sssampledbnormal-md.md)] database.  
  
```sql  
SELECT DISTINCT Name  
       , MIN(Rate) OVER (PARTITION BY edh.DepartmentID) AS MinSalary  
       , MAX(Rate) OVER (PARTITION BY edh.DepartmentID) AS MaxSalary  
       , AVG(Rate) OVER (PARTITION BY edh.DepartmentID) AS AvgSalary  
       ,COUNT(edh.BusinessEntityID) OVER (PARTITION BY edh.DepartmentID) AS EmployeesPerDept  
FROM HumanResources.EmployeePayHistory AS eph  
JOIN HumanResources.EmployeeDepartmentHistory AS edh  
     ON eph.BusinessEntityID = edh.BusinessEntityID  
JOIN HumanResources.Department AS d  
 ON d.DepartmentID = edh.DepartmentID  
WHERE edh.EndDate IS NULL  
ORDER BY Name;  
```  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssResult](../../includes/ssresult-md.md)]  
  
```  
Name                          MinSalary             MaxSalary             AvgSalary             EmployeesPerDept

 (16 row(s) affected)  
```  
  
### C. Using MAX with character data   
The following example returns the database name that sorts as the last name alphabetically. The example uses `WHERE database_id < 5`, to consider only the system databases.  
```sql   
SELECT MAX(name) FROM sys.databases WHERE database_id < 5;
```
The last system database is `tempdb`.
