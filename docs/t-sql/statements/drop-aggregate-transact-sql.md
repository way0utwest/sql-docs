# DROP AGGREGATE (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Removes a user-defined aggregate function from the current database. User-defined aggregate functions are created by using [CREATE AGGREGATE](../../t-sql/statements/create-aggregate-transact-sql.md).  
  
 ![Topic link icon](../../database-engine/configure-windows/media/topic-link.gif "Topic link icon") [Transact-SQL Syntax Conventions](../../t-sql/language-elements/transact-sql-syntax-conventions-transact-sql.md)  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
DROP AGGREGATE [ IF EXISTS ] [ schema_name . ] aggregate_name  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 *IF EXISTS*  
 **Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] ([!INCLUDE[ssSQL15](../../includes/sssql15-md.md)] through [current version](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=299658)).  
  
 Conditionally drops the aggregate only if it already exists.  
  
 *schema_name*  
 Is the name of the schema to which the user-defined aggregate function belongs.  
  
 *aggregate_name*  
 Is the name of the user-defined aggregate function you want to drop.  
  
## Remarks  
 DROP AGGREGATE does not execute if there are any views, functions, or stored procedures created with schema binding that reference the user-defined aggregate function you want to drop.  
  
## Permissions  
 To execute DROP AGGREGATE, at a minimum, a user must have ALTER permission on the schema to which the user-defined aggregate belongs, or CONTROL permission on the aggregate.  
  
## Examples  
 The following example drops the aggregate `Concatenate`.  
  
```  
DROP AGGREGATE dbo.Concatenate;  
```
