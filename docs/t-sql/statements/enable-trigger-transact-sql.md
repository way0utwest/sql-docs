# ENABLE TRIGGER (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-asdb-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-asdb-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

  Enables a DML, DDL, or logon trigger.  
  
 ![Topic link icon](../../database-engine/configure-windows/media/topic-link.gif "Topic link icon") [Transact-SQL Syntax Conventions](../../t-sql/language-elements/transact-sql-syntax-conventions-transact-sql.md)  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
ENABLE TRIGGER { [ schema_name . ] trigger_name [ ,...n ] | ALL }  
ON { object_name | DATABASE | ALL SERVER } [ ; ]  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 *schema_name*  
 Is the name of the schema to which the trigger belongs. *schema_name* cannot be specified for DDL or logon triggers.  
  
 *trigger_name*  
 Is the name of the trigger to be enabled.  
  
 ALL  
 Indicates that all triggers defined at the scope of the ON clause are enabled.  
  
 *object_name*  
 Is the name of the table or view on which the DML trigger *trigger_name* was created to execute.  
  
 DATABASE  
 For a DDL trigger, indicates that *trigger_name* was created or modified to execute with database scope.  
  
 ALL SERVER  
 **Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../includes/sskatmai-md.md)] through [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)].  
  
 For a DDL trigger, indicates that *trigger_name* was created or modified to execute with server scope. ALL SERVER also applies to logon triggers.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  This option is not available in a contained database.  
  
## Remarks  
 Enabling a trigger does not re-create it. A disabled trigger still exists as an object in the current database, but does not fire. Enabling a trigger causes it to fire when any [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] statements on which it was originally programmed are executed. Triggers are disabled by using [DISABLE TRIGGER](../../t-sql/statements/disable-trigger-transact-sql.md). DML triggers defined on tables can be also be disabled or enabled by using [ALTER TABLE](../../t-sql/statements/alter-table-transact-sql.md).  
  
## Permissions  
 To enable a DML trigger, at a minimum, a user must have ALTER permission on the table or view on which the trigger was created.  
  
 To enable a DDL trigger with server scope (ON ALL SERVER) or a logon trigger, a user must have CONTROL SERVER permission on the server. To enable a DDL trigger with database scope (ON DATABASE), at a minimum, a user must have ALTER ANY DATABASE DDL TRIGGER permission in the current database.  
  
## Examples  
  
### A. Enabling a DML trigger on a table  
 The following example disables trigger `uAddress` that was created on table `Address` in the AdventureWorks database, and then enables it.  
  
```  
DISABLE TRIGGER Person.uAddress ON Person.Address;  
GO  
ENABLE Trigger Person.uAddress ON Person.Address;  
GO  
```  
  
### B. Enabling a DDL trigger  
 The following example creates a DDL trigger `safety` with database scope, and then disable and enables it.  
  
```  
CREATE TRIGGER safety   
ON DATABASE   
FOR DROP_TABLE, ALTER_TABLE   
AS   
   PRINT 'You must disable Trigger "safety" to drop or alter tables!'   
   ROLLBACK;  
GO  
DISABLE TRIGGER safety ON DATABASE;  
GO  
ENABLE TRIGGER safety ON DATABASE;  
GO  
```  
  
### C. Enabling all triggers that were defined with the same scope  
 The following example enables all DDL triggers that were created at the server scope.  
  
**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../includes/sskatmai-md.md)] through [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)].  
  
```  
ENABLE Trigger ALL ON ALL SERVER;  
GO  
```
