# CREATE EXTERNAL RESOURCE POOL (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2016-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2016-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]
**Applies to:** [!INCLUDE[sssql15-md](../../includes/sssql15-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[rsql-productname-md](../../includes/rsql-productname-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[sssql17-md](../../includes/sssql17-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[rsql-productnamenew-md](../../includes/rsql-productnamenew-md.md)]

Creates an external pool used to define resources for external processes. A resource pool represents a subset of the physical resources (memory and CPUs) of an instance of the Database Engine. Resource Governor enables a database administrator to distribute server resources among resource pools, up to a maximum of 64 pools.

+ For [!INCLUDE[rsql-productname-md](../../includes/rsql-productname-md.md)] in [!INCLUDE[sssql15-md](../../includes/sssql15-md.md)], the external pool governs `rterm.exe`, `BxlServer.exe`, and other processes spawned by them.

+ For [!INCLUDE[rsql-productnamenew-md](../../includes/rsql-productnamenew-md.md)] in [!INCLUDE[sssql17-md](../../includes/sssql17-md.md)], the external pool governs the R processes listed for SQL Server 2016, as well as `python.exe`, `BxlServer.exe`, and other processes spawned by them.

## Syntax  
  
```  
CREATE EXTERNAL RESOURCE POOL pool_name  
[ WITH (  
    [ MAX_CPU_PERCENT = value ]  
    [ [ , ] AFFINITY CPU =    
            {  
                AUTO   
              | ( <cpu_range_spec> )   
              | NUMANODE = ( <NUMA_node_id> )   
            } ]   
    [ [ , ] MAX_MEMORY_PERCENT = value ]  
    [ [ , ] MAX_PROCESSES = value ]   
    )   
]  
[ ; ]  
  
<CPU_range_spec> ::=    
{ CPU_ID | CPU_ID  TO CPU_ID } [ ,...n ]  
```  
  
## Arguments

*pool_name*  
Is the user-defined name for the external resource pool. *pool_name* is alphanumeric, can be up to 128 characters, must be unique within an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], and must comply with the rules for [identifiers](../../relational-databases/databases/database-identifiers.md).  

MAX_CPU_PERCENT =*value*  
Specifies the maximum average CPU bandwidth that all requests in the external resource pool can receive when there is CPU contention. *value* is an integer with a default setting of 100. The allowed range for *value* is from 1 through 100.

AFFINITY {CPU = AUTO | ( \<CPU_range_spec> ) | NUMANODE = (\<NUMA_node_range_spec>)}
Attach the external resource pool to specific CPUs. The default value is AUTO.

AFFINITY CPU = **(** \<CPU_range_spec> **)** maps the external resource pool to the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] CPUs identified by the given CPU_IDs.

When you use AFFINITY NUMANODE = **(** \<NUMA_node_range_spec> **)**, the external resource pool is affinitized to the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] physical CPUs that correspond to the given NUMA node or range of nodes. 

MAX_MEMORY_PERCENT =*value*  
Specifies the total server memory that can be used by requests in this external resource pool. *value* is an integer with a default setting of 100. The allowed range for *value* is from 1 through 100.

MAX_PROCESSES =*value*  
Specifies the maximum number of processes allowed for the external resource pool. Specify 0 to set an unlimited threshold for the pool, which is thereafter bound only by computer resources. The default is 0.

## Remarks

The [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] implements the resource pool when you execute the [ALTER RESOURCE GOVERNOR RECONFIGURE](../../t-sql/statements/alter-resource-governor-transact-sql.md) statement.

 For general information about resource pools, see [Resource Governor Resource Pool](../../relational-databases/resource-governor/resource-governor-resource-pool.md), [sys.resource_governor_external_resource_pools &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../relational-databases/system-catalog-views/sys-resource-governor-external-resource-pools-transact-sql.md), and [sys.dm_resource_governor_external_resource_pool_affinity &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-resource-governor-external-resource-pool-affinity-transact-sql.md).

For information specific to managing external resource pools used for machine learning, see [Resource governance for machine learning in SQL Server](../../advanced-analytics/r/resource-governance-for-r-services.md). 

## Permissions

Requires `CONTROL SERVER` permission.

## Examples

The following statement defines an external pool that restricts CPU usage to 75 percent and the maximum memory to 30 percent of the available memory on the computer.

```sql
CREATE EXTERNAL RESOURCE POOL ep_1
WITH (  
    MAX_CPU_PERCENT = 75
    , AFFINITY CPU = AUTO
    , MAX_MEMORY_PERCENT = 30
);
GO
ALTER RESOURCE GOVERNOR RECONFIGURE;
GO
```
