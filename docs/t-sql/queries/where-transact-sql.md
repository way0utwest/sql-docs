# WHERE (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-all-md](../../includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-all-md.md)]

  Specifies the search condition for the rows returned by the query.  
  
 ![Topic link icon](../../database-engine/configure-windows/media/topic-link.gif "Topic link icon") [Transact-SQL Syntax Conventions](../../t-sql/language-elements/transact-sql-syntax-conventions-transact-sql.md)  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
[ WHERE <search_condition> ]  
```  
  
## Arguments  
\< *search_condition* >
 Defines the condition to be met for the rows to be returned. There is no limit to the number of predicates that can be included in a search condition. For more information about search conditions and predicates, see [Search Condition &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/queries/search-condition-transact-sql.md).  
  
## Examples  
 The following examples show how to use some common search conditions in the `WHERE` clause.  
  
### A. Finding a row by using a simple equality  
  
```  
-- Uses AdventureWorks  
  
SELECT EmployeeKey, LastName  
FROM DimEmployee  
WHERE LastName = 'Smith' ;  
```  
  
### B. Finding rows that contain a value as part of a string  
  
```  
-- Uses AdventureWorks  
  
SELECT EmployeeKey, LastName  
FROM DimEmployee  
WHERE LastName LIKE ('%Smi%');  
```  
  
### C. Finding rows by using a comparison operator  
  
```  
-- Uses AdventureWorks  
  
SELECT EmployeeKey, LastName  
FROM DimEmployee  
WHERE EmployeeKey  <= 500;  
```  
  
### D. Finding rows that meet any of three conditions  
  
```  
-- Uses AdventureWorks  
  
SELECT EmployeeKey, LastName  
FROM DimEmployee  
WHERE EmployeeKey = 1 OR EmployeeKey = 8 OR EmployeeKey = 12;  
```  
  
### E. Finding rows that must meet several conditions  
  
```  
-- Uses AdventureWorks  
  
SELECT EmployeeKey, LastName  
FROM DimEmployee  
WHERE EmployeeKey <= 500 AND LastName LIKE '%Smi%' AND FirstName LIKE '%A%';  
```  
  
### F. Finding rows that are in a list of values  
  
```  
-- Uses AdventureWorks  
  
SELECT EmployeeKey, LastName  
FROM DimEmployee  
WHERE LastName IN ('Smith', 'Godfrey', 'Johnson');  
```  
  
### G. Finding rows that have a value between two values  
  
```  
-- Uses AdventureWorks  
  
SELECT EmployeeKey, LastName  
FROM DimEmployee  
WHERE EmployeeKey Between 100 AND 200;  
```
