# DBCC PDW_SHOWEXECUTIONPLAN (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-xxxxxx-xxxx-asdw-pdw-md](../../includes/tsql-appliesto-xxxxxx-xxxx-asdw-pdw-md.md)]

Displays the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] execution plan for a query running on a specific [!INCLUDE[ssSDW](../../includes/sssdw-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[ssPDW](../../includes/sspdw-md.md)] Compute node or Control node. Use this to troubleshoot query performance problems while queries are running on the Compute nodes and Control node.
  
Once query performance problems are understood for SMP [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] queries running on the Compute nodes, there are several ways to improve performance. Possible ways to improve query performance on the Compute nodes include creating multi-column statistics, creating non-clustered indexes, or using query hints.

## Syntax  
Syntax for SQL Server:

```sql
DBCC PDW_SHOWEXECUTIONPLAN ( distribution_id, spid )  
[;]  
```  
Syntax Azure Parallel Data Warehouse:
  
```sql
DBCC PDW_SHOWEXECUTIONPLAN ( pdw_node_id, spid )  
[;]  
```  
  
## Arguments  
 *distribution_id*  
 Identifier for the distribution that is running the query plan. This is an integer and cannot be NULL. Used when targeting [!INCLUDE[ssSDW](../../includes/sssdw-md.md)].  
  
 *pdw_node_id*  
 Identifier for the node that is running the query plan. This is an integer and cannot be NULL. Used when targeting an Appliance.  
  
 *spid*  
 Identifier for the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] session that is running the query plan. This is an integer and cannot be NULL.  
  
## Permissions  
 Requires CONTROL permission on [!INCLUDE[ssSDW](../../includes/sssdw-md.md)].  
  
Requires VIEW-SERVER-STATE permission on the Appliance.
  
## Examples: [!INCLUDE[ssSDW](../../includes/sssdw-md.md)]  
  
### A. DBCC PDW_SHOWEXECUTIONPLAN Basic Syntax  
 When running on a [!INCLUDE[ssSDW](../../includes/sssdw-md.md)] instance, modify the above query to also select the distribution_id.  
  
```sql
SELECT [sql_spid], [pdw_node_id], [request_id], [dms_step_index], [type], [start_time], [end_time], [status], [distribution_id]  
FROM sys.dm_pdw_dms_workers   
WHERE [status] <> 'StepComplete' and [status] <> 'StepError'  
order by request_id, [dms_step_index];  
```  
  
This will return the spid for each actively running distribution. If you were curious as to what distribution 1 was running in session 375, you would run the following command.
  
```sql
DBCC PDW_SHOWEXECUTIONPLAN ( 1, 375 );  
```  

## Examples: [!INCLUDE[ssPDW](../../includes/sspdw-md.md)]  
### B. DBCC PDW_SHOWEXECUTIONPLAN Basic Syntax  
 The query that is running too long is either running a DMS query plan operation or a SQL query plan operation.  
  
If the query is running a DMS query plan operation, you can use the following query to retrieve a list of the node IDs and session IDs for steps that are not complete.
  
```sql
SELECT [sql_spid], [pdw_node_id], [request_id], [dms_step_index], [type], [start_time], [end_time], [status]   
FROM sys.dm_pdw_dms_workers   
WHERE [status] <> 'StepComplete' and [status] <> 'StepError'  
AND pdw_node_id = 201001   
order by request_id, [dms_step_index], [distribution_id];  
```  
  
Based on the results of the preceding query, use the sql_spid and pdw_node_id as parameters to DBCC PDW_SHOWEXEUCTIONPLAN. For example, the following command shows the execution plan for pdw_node_id 201001 and sql_spid 375.
  
```sql
DBCC PDW_SHOWEXECUTIONPLAN ( 201001, 375 );  
```
