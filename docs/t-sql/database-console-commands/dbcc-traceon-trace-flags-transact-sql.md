# DBCC TRACEON - Trace Flags (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2012-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2012-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

Trace flags are used to temporarily set specific server characteristics or to switch off a particular behavior. For example, if trace flag 3205 is set when an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] starts, hardware compression for tape drivers is disabled. Trace flags are frequently used to diagnose performance issues or to debug stored procedures or complex computer systems.
  
The following table lists and describes the trace flags that are available in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].
 
> [!NOTE]
> Some trace flags were introduced in specific [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] versions. For more information on the applicable version, see the Microsoft Support article associated with a specific trace flag.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Trace flag behavior may not be supported in future releases of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. 

  
|Trace flag|Description|  
|---|---|
|**139**| Forces correct conversion semantics in the scope of DBCC check commands like [DBCC CHECKDB](../../t-sql/database-console-commands/dbcc-checkdb-transact-sql.md), [DBCC CHECKTABLE](../../t-sql/database-console-commands/dbcc-checktable-transact-sql.md) and [DBCC CHECKCONSTRAINTS](../../t-sql/database-console-commands/dbcc-checkconstraints-transact-sql.md), when analyzing the improved precision and conversion logic introduced with compatibility level 130 for specific data types, on a database that has a lower compatibility level. For more information, see this [Microsoft Support article](http://support.microsoft.com/help/4010261).<br /><br />**Note:** This trace flag applies to [!INCLUDE[ssSQL15](../../includes/sssql15-md.md)] RTM CU3, [!INCLUDE[ssSQL15](../../includes/sssql15-md.md)] SP1 and higher builds.<br /><br />**WARNING:** Trace flag 139 is not meant to be enabled continuously in a production environment, and should be used for the sole purpose of performing database validation checks described in this [Microsoft Support article](http://support.microsoft.com/help/4010261). It should be immediately disabled after validation checks are completed.<br /><br />**Scope**: global only|
|**174**|Increases the [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)] plan cache bucket count from 40,009 to 160,001 on 64-bit systems. For more information, see this [Microsoft Support article](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/3026083).<br /><br />**Note:** Please ensure that you thoroughly test this option, before rolling it into a production environment.<br /><br />**Scope**: global only|
|**176**|Enables a fix to address errors when rebuilding partitions online for tables that contain a computed partitioning column. For more information, see this [Microsoft Support article](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/3213683).<br /><br />**Scope**: global or session|
|**205**|Reports to the error log when a statistics-dependent stored procedure is being recompiled as a result of auto-update statistics. For more information, see this [Microsoft Support article](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/195565).<br /><br />**Scope**: global only|
|**260**|Prints versioning information about extended stored procedure dynamic-link libraries (DLLs). For more information about **GetXpVersion()**, see [Creating Extended Stored Procedures](../../relational-databases/extended-stored-procedures-programming/creating-extended-stored-procedures.md).<br /><br />**Scope:** global or session|
|**272**|Disables identity pre-allocation to avoid gaps in the values of an identity column in cases where the server restarts unexpectedly or fails over to a secondary server. Note that identity caching is used to improve INSERT performance on tables with identity columns.<br /><br />**Note:** Starting with [!INCLUDE[ssSQL17](../../includes/sssql17-md.md)], to accomplish this at the database level, see the IDENTITY_CACHE option in [ALTER DATABASE SCOPED CONFIGURATION &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/statements/alter-database-scoped-configuration-transact-sql.md).<br /><br />**Scope**: global only|
|**610**|Controls minimally logged inserts into indexed tables. This trace flag is not required starting SQL Server 2016 as minimal logging is turned on by default for indexed tables. In SQL Server 2016, when the bulk load operation causes a new page to be allocated, all of the rows sequentially filling that new page are minimally logged if all the other pre-requisites for minimal logging are met. Rows inserted into existing pages (no new page allocation) to maintain index order are still fully logged, as are rows that are moved as a result of page splits during the load. It is also important to have ALLOW_PAGE_LOCKS turned ON for indexes (which is ON by default) for minimal logging operation to work as page locks are acquired during allocation and thereby only page or extent allocations are logged.For more information, see [Data Loading Performance Guide](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dd425070.aspx).<br /><br />**Scope**: global or session|
|**634**|Disables the background columnstore compression task. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] periodically runs the Tuple Mover background task that compresses columnstore index rowgroups with uncompressed data, one such rowgroup at a time.<br /><br />Columnstore compression improves query performance but also consumes system resources. You can control the timing of columnstore compression manually, by disabling the background compression task with trace flag 634, and then explicitly invoking ALTER INDEX...REORGANIZE or ALTER INDEX...REBUILD at the time of your choice.<br /><br />**Scope:** global only|
|**652**|Disables page pre-fetching scans. For more information, see this [Microsoft Support article](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/920093).<br /><br />**Scope**: global or session|
|**661**|Disables the ghost record removal process. For more information, see this [Microsoft Support article](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/920093).<br /><br />**Scope**: global only|
|**692**|Disables fast inserts while bulk loading data into heap or clustered index. Starting [!INCLUDE[ssSQL15](../../includes/sssql15-md.md)], fast inserts is enabled by default leveraging minimal logging when database is in simple or bulk logged recovery model to optimize insert performance for records inserted into new pages. With fast inserts, each bulk load batch acquires new extent(s) bypassing the allocation lookup for existing extent with available free space to optimize insert performance.<br /><br /> With fast inserts, bulk loads with small batch sizes can lead to increased unused space consumed by objects hence it is recommended to use large batchsize for each batch to fill the extent completely. If increasing batchsize is not feasible, this traceflag can help reduce unused space reserved at the expense of performance. <br /><br />**Note:** This trace flag applies to [!INCLUDE[ssSQL15](../../includes/sssql15-md.md)] RTM and higher builds.<br /><br />**Scope**: global or session|
|**715**|Enables table lock for bulk load operations into a heap with no non-clustered indexes. When this trace flag is enabled, bulk load operations acquire bulk update (BU) locks when bulk copying data into a table. Bulk update (BU) locks allow multiple threads to bulk load data concurrently into the same table, while preventing other processes that are not bulk loading data from accessing the table.<br /><br />The behavior is similar to when the user explicitly specifies TABLOCK hint while performing bulk load, or when the sp_tableoption table lock on bulk load is enabled for a given table. However, when this trace flag is enabled, this behavior becomes default without any query or database changes.<br /><br />**Scope:** global or session|
|**834**|Uses Microsoft Windows large-page allocations for the buffer pool. For more information, see this [Microsoft Support article](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/3210239).<br /><br />**Note:** If you are using the Columnstore Index feature of [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../includes/sssql11-md.md)] to [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)], we do not recommend turning on trace flag 834.<br /><br />**Scope**: global only|
|**845**|Enables locked pages on Standard SKUs of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], when the service account for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] has the Lock Pages in Memory privilege enabled. For more information, see this [Microsoft Support article](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/970070) and the documentation page on [Server Memory Server Configuration Options](../../database-engine/configure-windows/server-memory-server-configuration-options.md#lock-pages-in-memory-lpim).<br /><br />**Note:** Starting with [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../includes/sssql11-md.md)] this behavior is enabled by default for Standard SKUs, and trace flag 845 must not be used.<br /><br />**Scope**: global only|
|**902**|Bypasses execution of database upgrade script when installing a Cumulative Update or Service Pack. If you encounter an error during script upgrade mode, it is recommended to contact Microsoft SQL Customer Service and Support (CSS) for further guidance. For more information, see this [Microsoft Support article](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2163980).<br /><br />**WARNING:** This trace flag is meant for troubleshooting of failed updates during script upgrade mode, and it is not supported to run it continuously in a production environment. Database upgrade scripts needs to execute successfully for a complete install of Cumulative Updates and Service Packs. Not doing so can cause unexpected issues with your [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] instance.<br /><br />**Scope**: global only|
|**1117**|When a file in the filegroup meets the autogrow threshold, all files in the filegroup grow.<br /><br />**Note:** Starting with [!INCLUDE[ssSQL15](../../includes/sssql15-md.md)] this behavior is controlled by the AUTOGROW_SINGLE_FILE and AUTOGROW_ALL_FILES option of ALTER DATABASE, and trace flag 1117 has no effect. For more information, see [ALTER DATABASE File and Filegroup Options &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/statements/alter-database-transact-sql-file-and-filegroup-options.md).<br /><br />**Scope:** global only|
|**1118**|Removes most single page allocations on the server, reducing contention on the SGAM page. When a new object is created, by default, the first eight pages are allocated from different extents (mixed extents). Afterwards, when more pages are needed, those are allocated from that same extent (uniform extent). The SGAM page is used to track these mixed extents, so can quickly become a bottleneck when numerous mixed page allocations are occurring. This trace flag allocates all eight pages from the same extent when creating new objects, minimizing the need to scan the SGAM page. For more information, see this [Microsoft Support article](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/328551).<br /><br />**Note:** Starting with [!INCLUDE[ssSQL15](../../includes/sssql15-md.md)] this behavior is controlled by the SET MIXED_PAGE_ALLOCATION option of ALTER DATABASE, and trace flag 1118 has no effect. For more information, see [ALTER DATABASE SET Options &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/statements/alter-database-transact-sql-set-options.md).<br /><br />**Scope:** global only|  
|**1204**|Returns the resources and types of locks participating in a deadlock and also the current command affected. For more information, see this [Microsoft Support article](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/832524).<br /><br />**Scope:** global only|  
|**1211**|Disables lock escalation based on memory pressure, or based on number of locks. The [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)] will not escalate row or page locks to table locks.<br /><br />Using this trace flag can generate excessive numbers of locks. This can slow the performance of the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)], or cause 1204 errors (unable to allocate lock resource) because of insufficient memory.<br /><br />If both trace flag 1211 and 1224 are set, 1211 takes precedence over 1224. However, because trace flag 1211 prevents escalation in every case, even under memory pressure, we recommend that you use 1224. This helps avoid "out-of-locks" errors when many locks are being used.<br /><br />**Scope**: global or session|  
|**1222**|Returns the resources and types of locks that are participating in a deadlock and also the current command affected, in an XML format that does not comply with any XSD schema.<br /><br />**Scope**: global only|  
|**1224**|Disables lock escalation based on the number of locks. However, memory pressure can still activate lock escalation. The [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] escalates row or page locks to table (or partition) locks if the amount of memory used by lock objects exceeds one of the following conditions:<br /><br />-   Forty percent of the memory that is used by [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)]. This is applicable only when the **locks** parameter of sp_configure is set to 0.<br />-   Forty percent of the lock memory that is configured by using the **locks** parameter of sp_configure. For more information, see [Server Configuration Options &#40;SQL Server&#41;](../../database-engine/configure-windows/server-configuration-options-sql-server.md).<br /><br />If both trace flag 1211 and 1224 are set, 1211 takes precedence over 1224. However, because trace flag 1211 prevents escalation in every case, even under memory pressure, we recommend that you use 1224. This helps avoid "out-of-locks" errors when many locks are being used.<br /><br />**Note:** Lock escalation to the table-level or HoBT-level granularity can also be controlled by using the LOCK_ESCALATION option of the [ALTER TABLE](../../t-sql/statements/alter-table-transact-sql.md) statement.<br /><br />**Scope:** global or session|
|**1236**|Enables database lock partitioning. For more information, see this [Microsoft Support article](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2926217).<br /><br />**Note:** Starting with [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../includes/sssql11-md.md)] SP3 and [!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../../includes/sssql14-md.md)] SP1 this behavior is controlled by the engine and trace flag 1236 has no effect.<br /><br />**Scope**: global only|
|**1237**|Allows the ALTER PARTITION FUNCTION statement to honor the current user-defined session deadlock priority instead of being the likely deadlock victim by default. For more information, see this [Microsoft Support article](http://support.microsoft.com/help/4025261).<br /><br />**Note:** Starting with [!INCLUDE[ssSQLv14](../../includes/sssqlv14-md.md)] and database [compatibility level](../../t-sql/statements/alter-database-transact-sql-compatibility-level.md) 140 this is the default behavior and trace flag 1237 has no effect.<br /><br />**Scope**: global or session or query|
|**1260**|Disable scheduler monitor dumps.<br /><br />**Scope**: global only|   
|**1448**|Enables the replication log reader to move forward even if the async secondaries have not acknowledged the reception of a change. Even with this trace flag enabled the log reader always waits for the sync secondaries. The log reader will not go beyond the min ack of the sync secondaries. This trace flag applies to the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], not just an availability group, an availability database, or a log reader instance. Takes effect immediately without a restart. This trace flag can be activated ahead of time or when an async secondary fails. For more information, see this [Microsoft Support article](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/937041).<br /><br />**Scope**: global only|   
|**1462**|Disables log stream compression for asynchronous availability groups. This feature is enabled by default on asynchronous availability groups in order to optimize network bandwidth. For more information, see [Tune compression for availability group](../../database-engine/availability-groups/windows/tune-compression-for-availability-group.md).<br /><br />**Scope**: global only| 
|**1800**|Enables [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] optimization when disks of different sector sizes are used for primary and secondary replica log files, in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Always On and Log Shipping environments. This trace flag is only required to be enabled on SQL Server instances with transaction log file residing on disk with sector size of 512 bytes. It is **not** required to be enabled on disk with 4k sector sizes. For more information, see this [Microsoft Support article](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/3009974).<br /><br />**Scope:** global only|
|**2301**|Enable advanced decision support optimizations. For more information, see this [Microsoft Support article](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/920093).<br /><br />**Scope**: global and session and query|
|**2312**|Enables you to set the query optimizer cardinality estimation model to the [!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../../includes/sssql14-md.md)] through [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] versions, dependent of the compatibility level of the database. For more information, see [Microsoft Support article](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2801413).<br /><br />Starting with [!INCLUDE[ssSQL15](../../includes/sssql15-md.md)] SP1, to accomplish this at the query level, add the USE HINT 'FORCE_DEFAULT_CARDINALITY_ESTIMATION' [query hint](../../t-sql/queries/hints-transact-sql-query.md)  instead of using this trace flag.<br /><br />**Scope**: global or session or query| 
|**2335**|Causes [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] to assume a fixed amount of memory is available during query optimization. It does not limit the memory [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] grants to execute the query. The memory configured for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] will still be used by data cache, query execution and other consumers. For more information, see this [Microsoft Support article](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2413549).<br /><br />**Note:** Please ensure that you thoroughly test this option, before rolling it into a production environment.<br /><br />**Scope**: global or session or query|
|**2340**|Causes [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] not to use a sort operation (batch sort) for optimized nested loop joins when generating a plan. For more information, see this [Microsoft Support article](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2009160).<br /><br />Starting with [!INCLUDE[ssSQL15](../../includes/sssql15-md.md)] SP1, to accomplish this at the query level, add the USE HINT 'DISABLE_OPTIMIZED_NESTED_LOOP' [query hint](../../t-sql/queries/hints-transact-sql-query.md)  instead of using this trace flag.<br /><br />**Note:** Please ensure that you thoroughly test this option, before rolling it into a production environment.<br /><br />**Scope**: global or session or query|
|**2371**|Changes the fixed auto update statistics threshold to dynamic auto update statistics threshold. For more information, see this [Microsoft Support article](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2754171).<br /><br />**Note:** Starting with [!INCLUDE[ssSQL15](../../includes/sssql15-md.md)] and under the [database compatibility level](../../relational-databases/databases/view-or-change-the-compatibility-level-of-a-database.md) 130, this behavior is controlled by the engine and trace flag 2371 has no effect.<br /><br />**Scope**: global only|
|**2389**|Enable automatically generated quick statistics for ascending keys (histogram amendment). If trace flag 2389 is set, and a leading statistics column is marked as ascending, then the histogram used to estimate cardinality will be adjusted at query compile time. For more information, see this [Microsoft Support article](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2801413).<br /><br />**Note:** Please ensure that you thoroughly test this option, before rolling it into a production environment.<br /><br />**Note:** This trace flag does not apply to CE version 120 or above. Use trace flag 4139 instead.<br /><br />**Scope**: global or session or query|
|**2390**|Enable automatically generated quick statistics for ascending or unknown keys (histogram amendment). If trace flag 2390 is set, and a leading statistics column is marked as ascending or unknown, then the histogram used to estimate cardinality will be adjusted at query compile time. For more information, see this [Microsoft Support article](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2801413).<br /><br />**Note:** Please ensure that you thoroughly test this option, before rolling it into a production environment.<br /><br />**Note:** This trace flag does not apply to CE version 120 or above. Use trace flag 4139 instead.<br /><br />**Scope**: global or session or query|
|**2430**|Enables alternate lock class cleanup. For more information, see this [Microsoft Support article](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2754301).<br /><br />**Scope**: global only| 
|**2453**|Allows a table variable to trigger recompile when enough number of rows are changed. For more information, see this [Microsoft Support article](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2952444).<br /><br />**Note:** Please ensure that you thoroughly test this option, before rolling it into a production environment.<br /><br />**Scope**: global or session or query|
|**2528**|Disables parallel checking of objects by DBCC CHECKDB, DBCC CHECKFILEGROUP, and DBCC CHECKTABLE. By default, the degree of parallelism is automatically determined by the query processor. The maximum degree of parallelism is configured just like that of parallel queries. For more information, see [Configure the max degree of parallelism Server Configuration Option](../../database-engine/configure-windows/configure-the-max-degree-of-parallelism-server-configuration-option.md).<br /><br />**Note:** Parallel DBCC checks should typically be enabled (default). The query processor reevaluates and automatically adjusts parallelism for each table or batch of tables checked by DBCC CHECKDB.<br /><br />The typical use scenario is when a system administrator knows that server load will increase before DBCC CHECKDB completes, and so chooses to manually decrease or disable parallelism, in order to increase concurrency with other user workload. However, disabling parallel checks in DBCC CHECKDB can cause it to take longer to complete.<br /><br />**Note:** If DBCC CHECKDB is executed using the TABLOCK option and parallelism is disabled, tables may be locked for longer periods of time.<br /><br />**Note:** Starting with [!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../../includes/sssql14-md.md)] SP2, a MAXDOP option is available to override the max degree of parallelism configuration option of sp_configure for the statement.<br /><br />**Scope**: global or session|
|**2549**|Runs the DBCC CHECKDB command assuming each database file is on a unique disk drive. DBCC CHECKDB command builds an internal list of pages to read per unique disk drive across all database files. This logic determines unique disk drives based on the drive letter of the physical file name of each file.<br /><br />**Note:** Do not use this trace flag unless you know that each file is based on a unique physical disk.<br /><br />**Note:** Although this trace flag improve the performance of the DBCC CHECKDB commands which target usage of the PHYSICAL_ONLY option, some users may not see any improvement in performance. While this trace flag improves disk I/O resources usage, the underlying performance of disk resources may limit the overall performance of the DBCC CHECKDB command. For more information, see [Microsoft Support article](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2634571).<br /><br />**Scope**: global only| 
|**2562**|Runs the DBCC CHECKDB command in a single "batch" regardless of the number of indexes in the database. By default, the DBCC CHECKDB command tries to minimize tempdb resources by limiting the number of indexes or "facts" that it generates by using a "batches" concept. This trace flag forces all processing into one batch.<br /><br />One effect of using this trace flag is that the space requirements for tempdb may increase. Tempdb may grow to as much as 5% or more of the user database that is being processed by the DBCC CHECKDB command.<br /><br />**Note:** Although this trace flag improve the performance of the DBCC CHECKDB commands which target usage of the PHYSICAL_ONLY option, some users may not see any improvement in performance. While this trace flag improves disk I/O resources usage, the underlying performance of disk resources may limit the overall performance of the DBCC CHECKDB command. For more information, see [Microsoft Support article](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2634571).<br /><br />**Scope**: global only|
|**2566**|Runs the DBCC CHECKDB command without data purity check unless DATA_PURITY option is specified.<br /><br />**Note:** Column-value integrity checks are enabled by default and do not require the DATA_PURITY option. For databases upgraded from earlier versions of SQL Server, column-value checks are not enabled by default until DBCC CHECKDB WITH DATA_PURITY has been run error free on the database at least once. After this, DBCC CHECKDB checks column-value integrity by default. For more information, see [Microsoft Support article](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/945770).<br /><br />**Scope**: global only|
|**3023**|Enables CHECKSUM option as default for BACKUP command. For more information, see this [Microsoft Support article](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2656988).<br /><br />**Note:** Starting with [!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../../includes/sssql14-md.md)] this behavior is controlled by setting the **backup checksum default** configuration option. For more information, see [Server Configuration Options &#40;SQL Server&#41;](../../database-engine/configure-windows/server-configuration-options-sql-server.md).<br /><br />**Scope**: global and session|
|**3042**|Bypasses the default backup compression pre-allocation algorithm to allow the backup file to grow only as needed to reach its final size. This trace flag is useful if you need to save on space by allocating only the actual size required for the compressed backup. Using this trace flag might cause a slight performance penalty (a possible increase in the duration of the backup operation). For more information about the pre-allocation algorithm, see [Backup Compression &#40;SQL Server&#41;](../../relational-databases/backup-restore/backup-compression-sql-server.md).<br /><br />**Scope**: global only|
|**3051**|Enables SQL Server Backup to URL logging to a specific error log file. For more information, see [SQL Server Backup to URL Best Practices and Troubleshooting](../../relational-databases/backup-restore/sql-server-backup-to-url-best-practices-and-troubleshooting.md).<br /><br />**Scope**: global only|  
|**3205**|By default, if a tape drive supports hardware compression, either the DUMP or BACKUP statement uses it. With this trace flag, you can disable hardware compression for tape drivers. This is useful when you want to exchange tapes with other sites or tape drives that do not support compression.<br /><br />**Scope**: global or session|  
|**3226**|By default, every successful backup operation adds an entry in the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] error log and in the system event log. If you create very frequent log backups, these success messages accumulate quickly, resulting in huge error logs in which finding other messages is problematic.<br /><br />With this trace flag, you can suppress these log entries. This is useful if you are running frequent log backups and if none of your scripts depend on those entries.<br /><br />**Scope**: global only|   
|**3427**|Enables fix for issue when many consecutive transactions inserting data into temp table in [!INCLUDE[ssSQL15](../../includes/sssql15-md.md)] consume more CPU than in [!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../../includes/sssql14-md.md)]. For more information, see [Microsoft Support article](http://support.microsoft.com/help/3216543)<br /><br />**Scope**: global only|  
|**3608**|Prevents [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] from automatically starting and recovering any database except the **master** database. If activities that require **tempdb** are initiated, then **model** is recovered and **tempdb** is created. Other databases will be started and recovered when accessed. Some features, such as snapshot isolation and read committed snapshot, might not work. Use for [Move System Databases](../../relational-databases/databases/move-system-databases.md) and [Move User Databases](../../relational-databases/databases/move-user-databases.md).<br /><br />**Note:** Do not use during normal operation.<br /><br />**Scope**: global only|   
|**3625**|Limits the amount of information returned to users who are not members of the sysadmin fixed server role, by masking the parameters of some error messages using '\*\*\*\*\*\*'. This can help prevent disclosure of sensitive information.<br /><br />**Scope**: global only|  
|**4136**|Disables parameter sniffing unless OPTION(RECOMPILE), WITH RECOMPILE or OPTIMIZE FOR \<value> is used. For more information, see [Microsoft Support article](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/980653).

## Remarks  
 In [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], there are three types of trace flags: query, session and global. Query trace flags are active for the context of a specific query. Session trace flags are active for a connection and are visible only to that connection. Global trace flags are set at the server level and are visible to every connection on the server. Some flags can only be enabled as global, and some can be enabled at either global or session scope.  
  
 The following rules apply:  
-   A global trace flag must be enabled globally. Otherwise, the trace flag has no effect. We recommend that you enable global trace flags at startup, by using the **-T** command line option. This ensures the trace flag remains active after a server restart.  
-   If a trace flag has either global, session or query scope, it can be enabled with the appropriate scope. A trace flag that is enabled at the session level never affects another session, and the effect of the trace flag is lost when the SPID that opened the session logs out.  
  
Trace flags are set on or off by using either of the following methods:
-   Using the DBCC TRACEON and DBCC TRACEOFF commands.  
     For example, to enable the 2528 trace flag globally, use DBCC TRACEON with the -1 argument: `DBCC TRACEON (2528, -1)`. The effect of enabling a global trace flag with DBCC TRACEON is lost on server restart. To turn off a global trace flag, use DBCC TRACEOFF with the -1 argument.  
-   Using the **-T** startup option to specify that the trace flag be set on during startup.  
     The **-T** startup option enables a trace flag globally. You cannot enable a session-level trace flag by using a startup option. This ensures the trace flag remains active after a server restart. For more information about startup options, see [Database Engine Service Startup Options](../../database-engine/configure-windows/database-engine-service-startup-options.md).
-   At the query level, by using the QUERYTRACEON [query hint](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2801413).
  
Use the `DBCC TRACESTATUS` command to determine which trace flags are currently active.
  
## Examples  
 The following example sets trace flag 3205 on for all sessions at the server level by using DBCC TRACEON.  
  
```sql  
DBCC TRACEON (3205,-1);  
```

You can enable all plan-affecting hotfixes controlled by trace flags 4199 and 4137 for a particular query.
  
```sql
SELECT x FROM correlated WHERE f1 = 0 AND f2 = 1 OPTION (QUERYTRACEON 4199, QUERYTRACEON 4137)
```
