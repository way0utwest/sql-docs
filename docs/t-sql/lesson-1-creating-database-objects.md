# Lesson 1: Creating Database Objects
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-all-md](../includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-all-md.md)]
This lesson shows you how to create a database, create a table in the database, and then access and change the data in the table. Because this lesson is an introduction to using [!INCLUDE[tsql](../includes/tsql-md.md)], it does not use or describe the many options that are available for these statements.  
  
[!INCLUDE[tsql](../includes/tsql-md.md)] statements can be written and submitted to the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../includes/ssde-md.md)] in the following ways:  
  
-   By using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)]. This tutorial assumes that you are using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../includes/ssmanstudio-md.md)], but you can also use [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../includes/ssmanstudio-md.md)] Express, which is available as a free download from the [Microsoft Download Center](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=67359).  
  
-   By using the [sqlcmd utility](../tools/sqlcmd-utility.md).  
  
-   By connecting from an application that you create.  
  
The code executes on the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../includes/ssde-md.md)] in the same way and with the same permissions, regardless of how you submit the code statements.  
  
To run [!INCLUDE[tsql](../includes/tsql-md.md)] statements in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../includes/ssmanstudio-md.md)], open [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../includes/ssmanstudio-md.md)] and connect to an instance of the [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)].
