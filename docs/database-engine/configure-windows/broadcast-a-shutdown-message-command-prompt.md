# Broadcast a Shutdown Message (Command Prompt)
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]
  This topic describes how to broadcast a shutdown message in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] by using the **net send** command. In the message, include the time the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] will be stopped so that users can finish their tasks.  
  
##  <a name="SSMSProcedure"></a>  
  
#### To broadcast a shutdown message  
  
1.  From a command prompt, enter:  
  
     **net send /users "message"**  
  
     The **/users** option specifies that the message be sent to all users connected to the server  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  The **net send** command requires the messenger service to be running on both the sending and the receiving computers. The messenger service is disabled by default on Windows Server 2003. For information about **net send**, see the Windows documentation.  
  
 On your network, it may be more appropriate to contact users by e-mail or the telephone. To determine which users are currently connected to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], use the Activity Monitor. For information on the Activity Monitor, see [Activity Monitor](../../relational-databases/performance-monitor/activity-monitor.md) and [Open Activity Monitor &#40;SQL Server Management Studio&#41;](../../relational-databases/performance-monitor/open-activity-monitor-sql-server-management-studio.md).
