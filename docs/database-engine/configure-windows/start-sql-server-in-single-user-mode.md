# Start SQL Server in Single-User Mode
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]
  Under certain circumstances, you may have to start an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] in single-user mode by using the **startup option -m.** For example, you may want to change server configuration options or recover a damaged master database or other system database. Both actions require starting an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] in single-user mode.  
  
 Starting [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] in single-user mode enables any member of the computer's local Administrators group to connect to the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] as a member of the sysadmin fixed server role. For more information, see [Connect to SQL Server When System Administrators Are Locked Out](../../database-engine/configure-windows/connect-to-sql-server-when-system-administrators-are-locked-out.md).  
  
 When you start an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] in single-user mode, note the following:  
  
-   Only one user can connect to the server.  
  
-   The CHECKPOINT process is not executed. By default, it is executed automatically at startup.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Stop the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent service before connecting to an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] in single-user mode; otherwise, the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent service uses the connection, thereby blocking it.  
  
When you start an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] in single-user mode, [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] can connect to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. Object Explorer in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../includes/ssmanstudio-md.md)] might fail because it requires more than one connection for some operations. To manage [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] in single-user mode, execute [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] statements by connecting only through the Query Editor in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../includes/ssmanstudio-md.md)], or use the [sqlcmd utility](../../tools/sqlcmd-utility.md).  
  
When you use the **-m** option with **SQLCMD** or [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../includes/ssmanstudio-md.md)], you can limit the connections to a specified client application. 

> [!NOTE]
> On Linux, **SQLCMD** must be capitalized as shown.

For example, **-m"SQLCMD"** limits connections to a single connection and that connection must identify itself as the **SQLCMD** client program. Use this option when you are starting [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] in single-user mode and an unknown client application is taking the only available connection. To connect through the Query Editor in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../includes/ssmanstudio-md.md)], use **-m"Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio - Query"**.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  Do not use this option as a security feature. The client application provides the client application name, and can provide a false name as part of the connection string.  
  
## Note for Clustered installations  
 For [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] installation in a clustered environment, when [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is started in single user mode, the cluster resource dll uses up the available connection thereby blocking any other connections to the server. When [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is in this state, if you try to bring [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent resource online, it may fail over the SQL resource to a different node if the resource is configured to affect the group.  
  
 To get around the problem use the following procedure:  
  
1.  Remove the â€“m startup parameter from the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] advanced Properties.  
  
2.  Take the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] resource offline.  
  
3.  From the current owner node of this group, issue the following command from the command prompt:  
    net start MSSQLSERVER /m.  
  
4.  Verify from the cluster administrator or failover cluster management console that the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] resource is still offline.  
  
5.  Connect to the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] now using the following command and do the necessary operation: SQLCMD -E -S\<servername>.  
  
6.  Once the operation is complete, close the command prompt and bring back the SQL and other resources online through cluster administrator.
