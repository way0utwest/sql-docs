# CLR strict security   
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

Controls the interpretation of the `SAFE`, `EXTERNAL ACCESS`, `UNSAFE` permission in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].   

|Value |Description | 
|----- |----- | 
|0 |Disabled - Provided for backwards compatibility. `Disabled` value is not recommended. | 
|1 |Enabled - Causes the [!INCLUDE[ssde-md](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] to ignore the `PERMISSION_SET` information on the assemblies, and always interpret them as `UNSAFE`.  `Enabled` is the default value for [!INCLUDE[sssqlv14](../../includes/sssqlv14-md.md)]. | 

>  [!WARNING]
>  CLR uses Code Access Security (CAS) in the .NET Framework, which is no longer supported as a security boundary. A CLR assembly created with `PERMISSION_SET = SAFE` may be able to access external system resources, call unmanaged code, and acquire sysadmin privileges. Beginning with [!INCLUDE[sssqlv14](../../includes/sssqlv14-md.md)], an `sp_configure` option called `clr strict security` is introduced to enhance the security of CLR assemblies. `clr strict security` is enabled by default, and treats `SAFE` and `EXTERNAL_ACCESS` assemblies as if they were marked `UNSAFE`. The `clr strict security` option can be disabled for backward compatibility, but this is not recommended. Microsoft recommends that all assemblies be signed by a certificate or asymmetric key with a corresponding login that has been granted `UNSAFE ASSEMBLY` permission in the master database. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] administrators can also add assemblies to a list of assemblies, which the Database Engine should trust. For more information, see [sys.sp_add_trusted_assembly](../../relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sys-sp-add-trusted-assembly-transact-sql.md).

## Remarks   

When enabled, the `PERMISSION_SET` option in the `CREATE ASSEMBLY` and `ALTER ASSEMBLY` statements is ignored at run-time, but the `PERMISSION_SET` options are preserved in metadata. Ignoring the option, minimizes breaking existing code statements.

`CLR strict security` is an `advanced option`.  

>  [!IMPORTANT]  
>  After enabling strict security, any assemblies that are not signed will fail to load. You must either alter or drop and recreate each assembly so that it is signed with a certificate or asymmetric key that has a corresponding login with the `UNSAFE ASSEMBLY` permission on the server.

## Permissions 

### To change this option  
Requires `CONTROL SERVER` permission, or membership in the `sysadmin` fixed server role.

### To create an CLR assembly   
The following permissions required to create a CLR assembly when `CLR strict security` is enabled:

- The user must have the `CREATE ASSEMBLY` permission  
- And one of the following conditions must also be true:  
  - The assembly is signed with a certificate or asymmetric key that has a corresponding login with the `UNSAFE ASSEMBLY` permission on the server. Signing the assembly is recommended.  
  - The database has the `TRUSTWORTHY` property set to `ON`, and the database is owned by a login that has the `UNSAFE ASSEMBLY` permission on the server. This option is not recommended.
