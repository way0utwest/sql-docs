# Validate a SQL Server Installation
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]
  The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] discovery report can be used to verify the version of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] and the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] features installed on the computer. The **Installed [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] features discovery report** displays a report of all [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2000](../../includes/ssversion2000-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../includes/ssversion2005-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../includes/sskatmai-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[ssKilimanjaro](../../includes/sskilimanjaro-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../includes/sssql11-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../../includes/sssql14-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[ssSQL15](../../includes/sssql15-md.md)], and [!INCLUDE[ssSQL15](../../includes/sssqlv14-md.md)] products and features that are installed on the local server. The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] features discovery report is available on the **Tools** page on the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Installation center.  
  
 ## Run [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] features discovery report  
  
 Launch the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Installation center, using the **Start** menu, point to **All Programs**, point to **[!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] \<Version Name>**, point to **Configuration Tools**, and click **[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Installation Center**. To run the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] features discovery report, click **Tools** in the left-hand navigation area of **[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Installation Center**, and then click **Installed [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] features discovery report**.  
  
 The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] discovery report is saved to %ProgramFiles%\\[!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]\\*nnn*\Setup Bootstrap\Log\\<last Setup Session\>.  
  
 You can also generate the discovery report through the command line. Run “Setup.exe /Action=RunDiscovery” from a command prompt If you add “/q” to the command line above no UI will be shown, but the report will still be created in %ProgramFiles%\\[!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]\\*nnn*\Setup Bootstrap\Log\\<last Setup Session\>.
