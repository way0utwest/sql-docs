# Install SQL Server Database Engine
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]
The [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] component of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is the core service for storing, processing, and securing data. The [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] provides controlled access and rapid transaction processing to meet the requirements of the most demanding data consuming applications in your enterprise.  
  
[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] supports up to 50 instances of the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] on a single computer. To create a typical [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] installation, see [Install SQL Server from the Installation Wizard &#40;Setup&#41;](../../database-engine/install-windows/install-sql-server-from-the-installation-wizard-setup.md).  
  
>[!IMPORTANT]
>For local installations, you must run Setup as an administrator. If you install [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] from a remote share, you must use a domain account that has read and execute permissions on the remote share.
