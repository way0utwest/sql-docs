# Install SQL Server on Server Core
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]
You can install [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] on a Server Core installation.   
  
The Server Core installation option provides a minimal environment for running specific server roles. This helps to reduce maintenance and management requirements and the attack surface for those server roles. For more information on Server Core, see [Install Server Core](http://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/get-started/getting-started-with-server-core). For more information on Server Core as implemented on [!INCLUDE[win8srv](../../includes/win8srv-md.md)], see [Server Core for Windows Server 2012](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh846323\(VS.85\).aspx) (http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh846323(VS.85).aspx).  
  
 For a list of currently supported operating systems, see [Hardware and Software Requirements for Installing SQL Server](../../sql-server/install/hardware-and-software-requirements-for-installing-sql-server.md).

## Prerequisites

## Upgrade 
 On Server Core installations, upgrading from [!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../../includes/sssql14-md.md)] to [!INCLUDE[ssSQL15](../../includes/sssql15-md.md)] is supported.  
  
## Install  
 [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] does not support setup by using the installation wizard on the Server Core operating system. When installing on Server Core, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Setup supports full quiet mode by using the /Q parameter, or Quiet Simple mode by using the /QS parameter. For more information, see [Install SQL Server 2016 from the Command Prompt](../../database-engine/install-windows/install-sql-server-2016-from-the-command-prompt.md).  
  
 Regardless of the installation method, you are required to confirm acceptance of the software license terms as an individual or on behalf of an entity, unless your use of the software is governed by a separate agreement such as a [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] volume licensing agreement or a third-party agreement with an ISV or OEM.  
  
 The license terms are displayed for review and acceptance in the Setup user interface. Unattended installations (using the /Q or /QS parameters) must include the /IACCEPTSQLSERVERLICENSETERMS parameter. You can review the license terms separately at [Microsoft Software License Terms](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=148209).  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Depending on how you received the software (for example, through [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] volume licensing), your use of the software may be subject to additional terms and conditions.  
  
 To install specific features, use the /FEATURES parameter and specify the parent feature or feature values. For more information about feature parameters and their use, see the following sections.

### Installation options  
 The Setup supports the following installation options while installing [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] on a Server Core operating system:  
  
1.  **Installation from Command Line**  
  
     To install specific features using the command prompt installation option, use the /FEATURES parameter and specify the parent feature or feature values. The following is an example of using the parameters from the command line:  
  
    ```  
    Setup.exe /qs /ACTION=Install /FEATURES=SQLEngine,Replication /INSTANCENAME=MSSQLSERVER /SQLSVCACCOUNT="<DomainName\UserName>" /SQLSVCPASSWORD="<StrongPassword>" /SQLSYSADMINACCOUNTS="<DomainName\UserName>" /AGTSVCACCOUNT="NT AUTHORITY\Network Service" /TCPENABLED=1 /IACCEPTSQLSERVERLICENSETERMS  
    ```  
  
2.  **Installation using Configuration File**  
  
     Setup supports the use of the configuration file only through the command prompt. The configuration file is a text file with the basic structure of a parameter (name/value pair) and a descriptive comment. The configuration file specified at the command prompt should have an .INI file name extension. See the following examples of ConfigurationFile.INI:

        ;Specifies acceptance of License Terms  
  
        IAcceptSQLServerLicenseTerms="True"  
        ```  
  
     The following shows how you can launch Setup using a custom or default configuration file:  
  
    -   Launch setup using a custom configuration file:  
  
         To specify the configuration file at the command prompt:  
  
        ```  
        Setup.exe /QS /ConfigurationFile=MyConfigurationFile.INI  
        ```  
  
         To specify passwords at the command prompt instead of in the configuration file:  
  
        ```  
        Setup.exe /QS /SQLSVCPASSWORD="************" /ASSVCPASSWORD="************"  /ConfigurationFile=MyConfigurationFile.INI  
        ```  
  
    -   Launch setup using DefaultSetup.ini:  
  
         If you have the DefaultSetup.ini file in the \x86 and \x64 folders at the root level of the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] source media, open the DefaultSetup.ini file, and then add the *Features* parameter to the file.  
  
         If the DefaultSetup.ini file does not exist, you can create it and copy it to the \x86 and \x64 folders at the root level of the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] source media.  
  
## Configure remote access of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] on Server Core  
 Perform the actions described below to configure remote access of a [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] instance that is running on Server Core.  
  
### Enable remote connections on the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]  

To enable remote connections, use SQLCMD.exe locally and execute the following statements against the Server Core instance:  

   ```Transact-SQL
   EXEC sys.sp_configure N'remote access', N'1'  
   GO
   RECONFIGURE WITH OVERRIDE
   GO
   ```  
  
### Enable and start the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] browser service  
 By default, the Browser service is disabled.  If it is disabled on an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] running on Server Core, run the following command from the command prompt to enable it:  
  
 `sc config SQLBROWSER start= auto`  
  
 After it is enabled, run the following command from the command prompt to start the service:  
  
 `net start SQLBROWSER`  
  
### Create exceptions in Windows Firewall  
 To create exceptions for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] access in Windows Firewall, follow the steps specified in [Configure the Windows Firewall to Allow SQL Server Access](../../sql-server/install/configure-the-windows-firewall-to-allow-sql-server-access.md).  
  
### Enable TCP/IP on the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]  
 The TCP/IP protocol can be enabled through Windows PowerShell for an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] on Server Core. Follow these steps:  
  
1.  On the server, launch Task Manager.  
  
2.  On the **Applications** tab, click **New Task**.  
  
3.  In the **Create New Task** dialog box, type **sqlps.exe** in the **Open** field and then click **OK**. This opens the **[!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Powershell** window.  
  
4.  In the **Microsoft [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Powershell** window, run the following script to enable the TCP/IP protocol:  
  
```powershell  
$smo = 'Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Smo.'  
$wmi = new-object ($smo + 'Wmi.ManagedComputer')  
# Enable the TCP protocol on the default instance.  If the instance is named, replace MSSQLSERVER with the instance name in the following line.  
$uri = "ManagedComputer[@Name='" + (get-item env:\computername).Value + "']/ServerInstance[@Name='MSSQLSERVER']/ServerProtocol[@Name='Tcp']"  
$Tcp = $wmi.GetSmoObject($uri)  
$Tcp.IsEnabled = $true  
$Tcp.Alter()  
$Tcp  
```  
  
## Uninstall

 After you log on to a computer that is running Server Core, you have a limited desktop environment with an Administrator command prompt. You can use this command prompt to launch the uninstall an of [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)]. To uninstall an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)], launch the uninstallation from the command prompt in full quiet mode by using the /Q parameter, or quiet simple mode by using the /QS parameter. The /QS parameter shows progress through the UI, but does not accept any input. /Q runs in a quiet mode without any user interface.  
  
 To uninstall an existing instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]:  
  
```  
Setup.exe /Q /Action=Uninstall /FEATURES=SQLEngine,AS,IS /INSTANCENAME=MSSQLSERVER  
```  
  
 To remove a named instance, specify the name of the instance instead of `MSSQLSERVER` in the preceding example.  
  
## Start a new command prompt

If you accidentally close the command prompt, you can start a new command prompt by following these steps:  
 
1.  Press Ctrl+Shift+Esc to display Task Manager.  
2.  On the **Applications** tab, click **New Task**.  
3.  In the **Create New Task** dialog box, type **cmd** in the **Open** field and then [!INCLUDE[clickOK](../../includes/clickok-md.md)].
