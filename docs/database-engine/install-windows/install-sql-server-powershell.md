# Install SQL Server PowerShell
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]
  [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Setup automatically configures PowerShell components.  

You install the software that provides [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] support for Windows PowerShell by using [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Setup. When you select any [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] features that require PowerShell support, Setup installs the following [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] PowerShell components:  
  
- The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] PowerShell snap-ins. The snap-ins are dll files that implement two types of Windows PowerShell support for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]:  
  
  - A set of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] cmdlets. Cmdlets are commands that implement a specific action. For example, **Invoke-Sqlcmd** runs a [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] or XQuery script that can also be run by using the **sqlcmd** utility, and **Invoke-PolicyEvaluation** reports whether [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] objects comply with policy-based management policies.  
  
  - A [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] provider. The provider lets you navigate the hierarchy of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] objects using a path similar to a file system path. Each object is associated with a class from the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Management object models. You can use the methods and properties of the class to perform work on the objects. For example, if you cd to a databases object in a path, you can use the methods and properties of the Microsoft.SqlServer.Managment.SMO.Database class to manage the database.  
 
- The **sqlps** module that is imported into Windows PowerShell sessions to load the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] snap-ins.  
 
- [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] supports starting Windows PowerShell sessions from the Object Explorer tree. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent supports Windows PowerShell job steps.  
  
Windows Server 2012 and later and Windows 8 and later come with PowerShell installed and configured. For information about installing Windows PowerShell see [Installing Windows PowerShell](http://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/setup/installing-windows-powershell).
