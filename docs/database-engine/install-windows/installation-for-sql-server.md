# SQL Server Installation
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]
The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Installation Wizard provides a single feature tree to install all [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] components:  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)]  
-   [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)]  
-   [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion-md.md)]  
-   [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)]  
-   [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../../includes/ssmdsshort-md.md)]  
-   [!INCLUDE[ssDQSnoversion](../../includes/ssdqsnoversion-md.md)]  
-   Connectivity components  
  
Starting with [!INCLUDE[ss2016](../../includes/sssql15-md.md)], SQL Server Management Tools is no longer installed from  the main feature tree; for details see [Download SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)](../../ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms.md)

- [Editions and supported features of [!INCLUDE[ss2017](../../includes/sssqlv14-md.md)]](~/sql-server/editions-and-components-of-sql-server-2017.md).  
- [Editions and supported features of [!INCLUDE[ss2016](../../includes/sssql15-md.md)]](~/sql-server/editions-and-components-of-sql-server-2016.md).
