# Install SQL Server
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]
 > For content related to previous versions of SQL Server, see [Install SQL Server 2014](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bb500395(SQL.120).aspx).

 Beginning with [!INCLUDE[sssql15](../../includes/sssql15-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[ssnoversion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is only available as a 64-bit application. Here are important details about how to get SQL Server and how to install it.

## Installation details
  
*  **Options**: Install through the Installation Wizard, a command prompt, or through sysprep
 
*  **Requirements**: Before you install, take some time to review installation requirements, system configuration checks, and security considerations in [Planning a SQL Server Installation](../../sql-server/install/planning-a-sql-server-installation.md) 

* **Process**: See [Installation for SQL Server](../../database-engine/install-windows/installation-for-sql-server-2016.md) for complete instructions on the installation process

* **Sample databases and sample code**: 
    * They are not installed as part of SQL Server setup by default 
    * To install them for non-Express editions of SQL Server, see the [GitHub](http://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples)
