# Install SQL Server Servicing Updates
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]
This topic provides information about installing updates for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssNoVersion-md.md)]. This section provides information about the following:  
  
- Installing updates for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssNoVersion-md.md)] during a new installation  
  
- Installing updates for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssNoVersion-md.md)] after it has already been installed.  
  
Install the latest [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] updates in a timely manner to make sure that systems are up-to-date with the most recent security updates.  
  
## Installing Updates for [!INCLUDE[noVersion](../../includes/ssNoVersion-md.md)] During a New Installation  
[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] setup integrates the latest product updates with the main product installation so that the main product and its applicable updates are installed at the same time. Product Update can search for the applicable updates from:  
  
- [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] Update  
  
- Windows Server Update Services (WSUS)  
  
- A local folder  
  
- A network share  
  
After Setup finds the latest versions of the applicable updates, it downloads and integrates them with the current [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] setup process. Product Update can include a cumulative update, service pack, or service pack plus cumulative update.  
  
## Installing Updates for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssNoVersion-md.md)] after it has already been installed  
On an installed instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssNoVersion-md.md)], we recommend that you apply the latest security updates and critical updates including general distribution releases (GDRs), service packs (SPs), and cumulative updates (CUs). For additional information, see the [March, 2016 announcement on the SQL Server Incremental Servicing Model (ISM)](http://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/sqlreleaseservices/announcing-updates-to-the-sql-server-incremental-servicing-model-ism/).

> [!NOTE]
> Starting with [!INCLUDE[ssSQL17](../../includes/sssql17-md.md)] we are adopting a simplified, predictable mainstream servicing lifecycle and service packs (SPs) will no longer be available. 
> Only cumulative updates (CUs), and general distribution releases (GDRs) when needed.
> For additional information, see the [September, 2017 announcement on the Modern Servicing Model for SQL Server (MSM)](http://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/sqlreleaseservices/announcing-the-modern-servicing-model-for-sql-server/).
  
The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] updates are available through [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] Update (MU), Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) and the Microsoft Download Center. Security and Critical updates for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] are available through [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] Update, and to be able to see these updates you need to opt-into MU through the Windows Update applet in Control panel.  
  
When you receive an update through [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] Update, it will update all [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] features to the latest version in an unattended mode. If you need more flexibility or donâ€™t have internet or WSUS access you will need to obtain the updates from the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] Download Center.
