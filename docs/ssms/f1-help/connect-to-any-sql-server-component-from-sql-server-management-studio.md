# Connect to Any SQL Server Component from SQL Server Management Studio
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-asdb-asdw-pdw-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-asdb-asdw-pdw-md.md)]
[!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull_md.md)] provides functionality for managing every component of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)]. Use [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../includes/ssmanstudio_md.md)] to connect to:  
  
-   An instance of the [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../../includes/ssdenoversion_md.md)].  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../includes/ssasnoversion_md.md)].  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion_md.md)].  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../../includes/ssrsnoversion_md.md)].  
  
Although [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../includes/ssmanstudio_md.md)] allows you to work with queries without first establishing a connection to a data source, most other tasks require a connection. [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../includes/ssmanstudio_md.md)] provides the **Connect to Server** dialog box to configure connection properties to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] components. When [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../includes/ssmanstudio_md.md)] starts, it opens the **Connect to Server** dialog box and prompts you to connect to a server. The **Connect to Server** dialog box retains the connection settings from the last time it was used.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> This feature can be turned off so no connection is automatically initiated. For more information, see [Database Engine Service Startup Options](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/d373298b-f6cf-458a-849d-7083ecb54ef5).  
  
## Saving Connections  
You can save connections to specific servers in Registered Servers, or you can save connections in projects with Solution Explorer.  
  
### Saving Connections in Registered Servers  
When you register a server, [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../includes/ssmanstudio_md.md)] saves the connection information in Registered Servers. To connect to a registered server, double-click the server name in Registered Servers. Object Explorer then opens a connection to the server.  
  
### Saving Connections in Solution Explorer  
Solution Explorer allows you to store related queries, scripts, connections, and other associated information in a project. Each script project contains a node called **Connections**, where you can save one or more connections. To add a connection, right-click **Connections**, and then click **New Connection**. To access a saved connection, expand **Connections** and double-click the connection. [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../includes/ssmanstudio_md.md)] opens a query window associated with that connection. When saved, scripts retain their association to a specific connection.
