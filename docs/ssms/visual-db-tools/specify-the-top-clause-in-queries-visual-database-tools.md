# Specify the TOP Clause in Queries (Visual Database Tools)
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-asdb-asdw-pdw-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-asdb-asdw-pdw-md.md)]
The TOP clause returns only the first *n* or *n percent* rows from a query. The TOP clause is useful when you want to inspect a portion of your results to find out if your query does what you expect it to do, without taking the resources necessary to return all of the query results.  
  
### To specify the TOP clause in queries  
  
1.  Open a query from Solution Explorer or create a new one.  
  
2.  From the **View** menu, click **Properties Window**.  
  
3.  In the **Properties Window**, locate and expand the **Top Specification** property.  
  
4.  Click the **(Top)** child property and set it to **Yes**.  
  
5.  In the **Expression** child property, type an expression that has a numeric result (for example, "10" or "2*5").  
  
6.  Click the **Percent** child property and indicate whether or not to treat the **Expression** property as a percentage of all rows returned (Yes) or as the absolute number of rows returned (No).  
  
7.  If your query uses the ORDER BY clause, click the **With Ties** child property and choose **Yes** to display all rows in a group if only part of the group is included or **No** to truncate them.  
  
As you work through the preceding procedure, notice that the TOP clause, displayed in the SQL pane, changes to reflect the current settings of the properties.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> You can also change the values of the child properties of the **Top Specification** by editing the TOP clause in the SQL pane.
