# Development, Test, and Production Databases (Visual Database Tools)
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-asdb-asdw-pdw-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-asdb-asdw-pdw-md.md)]
If you have two databases with identical structure, you can make changes in one database and propagate those changes to the other. For example, if you have a personal development database and a group-wide test database, you can modify the development database, then propagate those changes to the test database.  
  
To accomplish this, perform all the modifications in a single session with the development database, create a Change Script of your session and later run the script on the test database.
