# Remove a Server Group (SQL Server Management Studio)
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-asdb-asdw-pdw-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-asdb-asdw-pdw-md.md)]
  This topic describes how to remove a server group in Registered Servers in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)] by using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)]. You can delete a server group at any time. If the server group is not empty, any servers or server groups contained in the deleted server group will also be deleted. Before deleting a server group, move any servers or server groups that you want to retain to a new server group.

#### To remove a server group
