# Projects (SQL Server Management Studio)
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-asdb-asdw-pdw-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-asdb-asdw-pdw-md.md)]
A [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../includes/ssmanstudio_md.md)] project is a collection of logically related scripts and files that can be saved together for database administration and development.  
  
## Script Project Overview  
[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] script projects are displayed in the Solution Explorer component of [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../includes/ssmanstudio_md.md)]. A script project can contain zero or more project files. You can add a project to a solution or combine more than one project within a solution.  
  
Projects can include the following:  
  
-   **Connections**. A connection, as persisted within a project, will contain login information, server name, default database, preferred protocol, authentication type, and connection properties. Connection information may optionally be stored with a script (see below).  
  
-   **SQLScripts**. Frequently used SQL scripts for the user. Double-clicking a .sql file within the project will cause the SQL Editor to open the selected script.  
  
-   **MDX, DMX, and XMLAScripts**. Frequently used MDX scripts for the user. Double-clicking an .mdx file within the project will cause the Editor to open the selected script.  
  
-   **Misc**. This folder can be used for files that do not neatly fit into any of the other default node types, such as a text file that contains the project objectives.  
  
Projects can also be integrated into a source code control system.  
  
## Connecting to an Instance of SQL Server from a Script Project  
A script project may contain connections to an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)]. You can connect to an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] in a project by clicking the connection. This will open an SQL Script window that is connected to the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] defined in the connection you selected. If you open a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] or MDX script with a connection that uses [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] authentication, you will be prompted for the password using the **Connect to SQL Server** dialog box after the Editor has been opened and the script loaded.  
  
The connection will be closed after the corresponding window is closed.  
  
To modify information about a connection, use the properties window in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../../includes/ssmanstudio_md.md)].
