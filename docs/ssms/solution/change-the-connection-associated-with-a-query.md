# Change the Connection Associated with a Query
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-asdb-asdw-pdw-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-asdb-asdw-pdw-md.md)]
A query can be executed against several different servers or databases by changing the connection used by the query.  
  
### To change the connection associated with a query  
  
1.  In Query Editor, right-click a blank area of Query Editor, point to **Connection**, and then click **Change Connection**.  
  
2.  In the **Connect to Database Engine** dialog box, provide the new connection information, and then click **Connect**.
