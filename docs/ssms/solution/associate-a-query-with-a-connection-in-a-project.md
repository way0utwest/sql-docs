# Associate a Query with a Connection in a Project
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-asdb-asdw-pdw-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-asdb-asdw-pdw-md.md)]
If a query was created without a connection, or if a query is moved from one project to another it will not be associated with a connection in the current project.  
  
### To associate a query with a connection in a project  
  
1.  If the query is open in query editor, right-click a blank area of query editor, point to **Connection**, and then click **Connect**. If the query is not open, double-click the query in Solution Explorer to connect the query.  
  
2.  In the **Connect to Database Engine** dialog box, provide the connection information. If the connection information matches an existing connection, the query will be associated with that connection.
