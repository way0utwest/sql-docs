# Add New Items to a Project
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-asdb-asdw-pdw-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-asdb-asdw-pdw-md.md)]
Add new items to a project to extend application functionality. A new item can be a query or a connection. [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull_md.md)] has two project types: [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] Script Project, and Analysis Services Script Project. The project type determines the items that you can add to the project. For example, you can add a [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql_md.md)] query (a file with a .sql extension) to a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] Script project, but you cannot add it to an Analysis Services Script Project.  
  
[!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull_md.md)] does not allow you to create folders within projects. To organize your work, create multiple projects within the solution.  
  
### To add a new query to an existing project  
  
1.  In Solution Explorer, select a target project.  
  
2.  On the **Project** menu, click **Add New Item**.  
  
3.  In the **Add New Item** dialog box, select a category in the left pane.  
  
4.  Select a query template in the right pane, and then click **Add**. The new query is added in the **Queries** folder of the project.  
  
5.  In the **Connect to Database Engine** dialog box, specify a connection for the new query, and then click **Connect**. You can click **Cancel** on the connection dialog if you do not want to associate a connection to the new query.  
  
6.  Rename the query in Solution Explorer if you wish.  
  
### To add a new connection to an existing project  
  
1.  In Solution Explorer, select a target project.  
  
2.  On the **Project** menu, click **Add New Item**.  
  
3.  Select **Connection** in the left pane.  
  
4.  Select **New Connection** in the right pane, and then click **Add**.  
  
5.  In the **Connect to Database Engine** dialog box, specify a connection for the new query, and then click **Connect**. The new connection gets added in the **Connections** folder of the project.
