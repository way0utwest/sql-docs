# Tutorial: SQL Server Management Studio
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-asdb-asdw-pdw-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-asdb-asdw-pdw-md.md)]

The SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) tutorial introduces you to the integrated environment for managing your [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] infrastructure. [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] presents a graphical interface for configuring, monitoring, and administering instances of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. It also allows you to deploy, monitor, and upgrade the data-tier components used by your applications, such as databases. [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] also provides [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)], MDX, DMX, and XML language editors for editing and debugging scripts.  
  
## What You Will Learn  
This tutorial will help you understand the presentation of information in SSMS and how to take advantage of its features.
  
The best way to get acquainted with SSMS is through hands-on practice. This tutorial will teach you how to manage the components of SSMS and how to find the features that you use regularly.

[Lesson 2: Writing Transact-SQL](lesson-2-writing-transact-sql.md)  
In this lesson, you will learn how to open Query Editor, how to manage code, and how to use other features of Query Editor.  
  
[Lesson 3: Working with Templates, Solutions, and Script Projects](lesson-3-working-with-templates-solutions-and-script-projects.md)  
In this lesson you will learn how to use templates, and organize scripts into solutions and projects.  
  
## Requirements  
This tutorial is intended for experienced database administrators and database developers who are not familiar with [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)], but who are familiar with database concepts and [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)].
