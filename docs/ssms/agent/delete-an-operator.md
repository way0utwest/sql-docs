1.  In **Object Explorer**, click the plus sign to expand the server that contains the operator you want to delete.  
  
2.  Click the plus sign to expand **SQL Server Agent**.

4.  Right-click the operator that you want to delete and select **Delete**.  
  
5.  In the **Delete Object** dialog box, make sure that the correct operator is selected, and then click **OK**. If you want another operator to receive the alerts and jobs sent to the deleted operator, check **Reassign to** and select an operator in the list.

    USE msdb ;  
    GO  
  
    EXEC sp_delete_operator @name = 'Test Operator',
