#### To clear the job history log  
  
1.  In **Object Explorer,** connect to an instance of the [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../../includes/ssdenoversion_md.md)], and then expand that instance.  
  
2.  Expand **SQL Server Agent**, and then expand **Jobs**.  
  
3.  Right-click a job and click **View history**.  
  
4.  In the **Log File Viewer**, select the job for which you want to clear history, and then do one of the following:  
  
    -   Click **Delete**, and then click **Delete all history** in the **Delete History** dialog. You can delete all job history or only history that is older than a specified date. If you want to remove all job history, click **Delete all history**. If you only want to remove older job history logs, click **Delete history before**, and then specify a date.  
  
    -   Click **Job status** if you want to clear the history log of a multiserver job. Click **Job**, click a job name, and then click **View Remote Job History**.  
  
5.  Click **Delete**.  
  
## <a name="TSQL"></a>Using Transact-SQL  
  
#### To clear the job history log  
  
1.  In **Object Explorer**, connect to an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde_md.md)].  
  
2.  On the Standard bar, click **New Query**.  
  
3.  Copy and paste the following example into the query window and click **Execute**.  
  
    ```  
    -- example removes the history for a job named NightlyBackups.  
    USE msdb ;  
    GO  
  
    EXEC dbo.sp_purge_jobhistory  
        @job_name = N'NightlyBackups' ;  
    GO  
    ```  
  
## <a name="SMO"></a>Using SQL Server Management Objects  
**To clear the job history log**  
  
Use the **PurgeJobHistory** method of the **JobServer** class by using a programming language that you choose, such as Visual Basic, Visual C#, or PowerShell. For more information, see [SQL Server Management Objects (SMO)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms162169.aspx).
