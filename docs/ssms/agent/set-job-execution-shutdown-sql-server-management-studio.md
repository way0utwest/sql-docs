# Set Job Execution Shutdown (SQL Server Management Studio)
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]
This topic describes how to set the time that [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] Agent will wait for executing jobs to finish before [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] Agent itself finishes in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent_md.md)] by using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull_md.md)].

By default, members of the **sysadmin** fixed server role can set the time that [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] Agent will wait for executing jobs to finish before [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] Agent itself finishes. Other users must be granted one of the following [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] Agent fixed database roles in the **msdb** database:  
  
-   **SQLAgentUserRole**  
  
-   **SQLAgentReaderRole**  
  
-   **SQLAgentOperatorRole**  
  
## <a name="SSMSProcedure"></a>Using SQL Server Management Studio  
  
#### To set job execution shutdown  
  
1.  In **Object Explorer,** , click the plus sign to expand the server where you want to set a job execution shutdown interval.  
  
2.  Right-click **SQL Server Agent** and select **Properties**.  
  
3.  Under **Select a page**, select **Job System**.  
  
4.  Set the **Shutdown time-out interval** in seconds to increase or decrease the shutdown time-out interval. This determines how long [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] Agent will wait for executing jobs to finish before [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] Agent itself finishes.
