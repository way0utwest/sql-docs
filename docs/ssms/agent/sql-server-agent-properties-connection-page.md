# SQL Server Agent Properties (Connection Page)
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]
Use this page to view and modify the settings for the connection from the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] Agent service to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)].  
  
## Options  
**Alias local host server**  
Specifies the alias to use to connect to the local instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)]. If you cannot use the default connection options for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] Agent, define an alias for the instance and specify the alias here.  
  
**Use Windows Authentication**  
Sets [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame_md.md)] Windows Authentication as the authentication method used to connect to the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] instance. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] Agent connects as the account that the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] Agent service runs as.  
  
**Use SQL Server Authentication**  
Sets [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] Authentication as the authentication method used to connect to the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] instance.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] Authentication is provided for backward compatibility. For improved security, use Windows Authentication if possible.  
  
**Login**  
Specifies the login name to use to connect to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)].  
  
**Password**  
Specifies the password to use to connect to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)].
