# Use Performance Objects
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]
[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] Agent includes performance objects and counters to monitor how the service is performing. These performance objects allow you to use Performance Monitor, a Windows tool, to identify what the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] Agent service is doing in the background. For example, you can identify how many active jobs the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] Agent service is currently running to identify those jobs that are blocked.  
  
The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] Agent service performance objects and counters exist for each instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] that is installed on a computer. Performance objects are named according to the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] that each object represents.  
  
The following table shows how the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] Agent service performance objects are named:  
  
|Instance type|Object name|  
|-----------------|---------------|  
|Default|**SQLAgent:***object*:*counter*|  
|Named|**SQLAgent$**<br /> **&#42;instance_name&#42; :***object*:*counter*|  
  
[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] includes the following performance objects for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion_md.md)] Agent.
