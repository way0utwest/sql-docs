# Choose Toolbox Items (Maintenance Tasks Page)
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-asdb-asdw-pdw-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-asdb-asdw-pdw-md.md)]
This tab of the **Customize Toolbox** dialog box displays a list of all maintenancetask components registered on your computer and makes it possible for you to change the ones that are displayed in the Toolbox. You can open the **Customize Toolbox** dialog box from the **Tools** menu. To sort the list of components, select any column heading.  
  
## Options  
The **Maintenance Tasks** tab includes the following columns of information.  
  
**Name**  
Displays the names of available components. Preceding each name is a check box. If selected, a check box indicates that [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull_md.md)] has found an entry for the component in your computer's registry. The component is either already displayed on the active **Toolbox** tab, or it will be added to it when you click **OK**. If cleared, a check box indicates that the component is not currently displayed in the **Toolbox**, or that it will be removed from the **Toolbox** when you click **OK**.  
  
**Path**  
Displays the full path to the component. To identify the default components that shipped with the product, sort on this column and then locate those stored on the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame_md.md)] Visual Studio installation path.  
  
**Last Modified**  
Displays the date when the component was last modified.  
  
Click on a name to show the attributes of the component in the **Language** and **Version** boxes, along with the icon.  
  
## Options  
**Language**  
The language of the component.  
  
**Version**  
The version of the component.
