# WMI Data Reader Task
  The WMI Data Reader task runs queries using the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) Query Language that returns information from WMI about a computer system. You can use the WMI Data Reader task for the following purposes:  
  
-   Query the Windows event logs on a local or remote computer and write the information to a file or variable.  
  
-   Obtain information about the presence, state, or properties of hardware components, and then use this information to determine whether other tasks in the control flow should run.  
  
-   Get a list of applications and determine what version of each application is installed.  
  
 You can configure the WMI Data Reader task in the following ways:  
  
-   Specify the WMI connection manager to use.  
  
-   Specify the source of the WQL query. The query can be stored in a task property, or the query can be stored outside the task, in a variable or a file.  
  
-   Define the format of the WQL query results. The task supports a table, property name/value pair, or property value format.  
  
-   Specify the destination of the query. The destination can be a variable or a file.  
  
-   Indicate whether the query destination is overwritten, kept, or appended.  
  
 If the source or destination is a file, the WMI Data Reader task uses a File connection manager to connect to the file. For more information, see [Flat File Connection Manager](../../integration-services/connection-manager/flat-file-connection-manager.md).  
  
 The WMI Data Reader task uses a WMI connection manager to connect to the server from which it reads WMI information. For more information, see [WMI Connection Manager](../../integration-services/connection-manager/wmi-connection-manager.md).  
  
## WQL Query  
 WQL is a dialect of SQL with extensions to support WMI event notification and other WMI-specific features. For more information about WQL, see the Windows Management Instrumentation documentation in the [MSDN Library](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=7022).  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  WMI classes vary between versions of Windows.  
  
 The following WQL query returns entries in the Application log event.  
  
```  
SELECT * FROM Win32_NTLogEvent WHERE LogFile = 'Application' AND (SourceName='SQLISService' OR SourceName='SQLISPackage') AND TimeGenerated > '20050117'  
```  
  
 The following WQL query returns logical disk information.  
  
```  
SELECT FreeSpace, DeviceId, Size, SystemName, Description FROM Win32_LlogicalDisk  
```  
  
 The following WQL query returns a list of the quick fix engineering (QFE) updates to the operating system.  
  
```  
Select * FROM Win32_QuickFixEngineering  
```  
  
## Custom Logging Messages Available on the WMI Data Reader Task  
 The following table lists the custom log entries for the WMI Data Reader task. For more information, see [Integration Services &#40;SSIS&#41; Logging](../../integration-services/performance/integration-services-ssis-logging.md).  
  
|Log entry|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|**WMIDataReaderGettingWMIData**|Indicates that the task began to read WMI data.|  
|**WMIDataReaderOperation**|Reports the WQL query that the task ran.|  
  
## Configuration of the WMI Data Reader Task
