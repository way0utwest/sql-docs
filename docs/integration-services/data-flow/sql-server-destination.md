# SQL Server Destination
  The SQL Server destination connects to a local [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] database and bulk loads data into [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] tables and views. You cannot use the SQL Server destination in packages that access a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] database on a remote server. Instead, the packages should use the OLE DB destination. For more information, see [OLE DB Destination](../../integration-services/data-flow/ole-db-destination.md).  
  
## Permissions  
 Users who execute packages that include the SQL Server destination require the "Create global objects" permission. You can grant this permission to users by using the Local Security Policy tool opened from the **Administrative Tools** menu. If you receive an error message when executing a package that uses the SQL Server destination, make sure that the account running the package has the "Create global objects" permission.  
  
## Bulk Inserts  
 If you attempt to use the SQL Server destination to bulk load data into a remote SQL Server database, you may see an error message similar to the following: "An OLE DB record is available. Source: "Microsoft [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client" Hresult: 0x80040E14 Description: "Could not bulk load because SSIS file mapping object 'Global\DTSQLIMPORT ' could not be opened. Operating system error code 2 (The system cannot find the file specified.). Make sure you are accessing a local server via Windows security.""  
  
 The SQL Server destination offers the same high-speed insertion of data into [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] that the Bulk Insert task provides; however, by using the SQL Server destination, a package can apply transformations to column data before the data is loaded into [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
 For loading data into [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], you should consider using the SQL Server destination instead of the OLE DB destination.  
  
### Bulk Insert Options  
 If the SQL Server destination uses a fast-load data access mode, you can specify the following fast load options:  
  
-   Retain identity values from the imported data file, or use unique values assigned by [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
-   Retain null values during the bulk load operation.  
  
-   Verify constraints on the target table or view during the bulk import operation.  
  
-   Acquire a table-level lock for the duration of the bulk load operation.  
  
-   Execute insert triggers defined on the destination table during the bulk load operation.  
  
-   Specify the number of the first row in the input to load during the bulk insert operation.  
  
-   Specify the number of the last row in the input to load during the bulk insert operation.  
  
-   Specify the maximum number of errors allowed before the bulk load operation is canceled. Each row that cannot be imported is counted as one error.  
  
-   Specify the columns in the input that contain sorted data.  
  
 For more information about bulk load options, see [BULK INSERT &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/statements/bulk-insert-transact-sql.md).  
  
#### Performance Improvements  
 To improve the performance of a bulk insert and the access to table data during the bulk insert operation, you should change the default options as follows:  
  
-   Do not verify constraints on the target table or view during the bulk import operation.  
  
-   Do not execute insert triggers defined on the destination table during the bulk load operation.  
  
-   Do not apply a lock to the table. That way, the table remains available to other users and applications during the bulk insert operation.  
  
## Configuration of the SQL Server Destination  
 You can configure the SQL Server destination in the following ways:  
  
-   Specify the table or view into which to bulk load the data.  
  
-   Customize the bulk load operation by specifying options such as whether to check constraints.  
  
-   Specify whether all rows commit in one batch or set the maximum number of rows to commit as a batch.  
  
-   Specify a time-out for the bulk load operation.  
  
 This destination uses an OLE DB connection manager to connect to a data source, and the connection manager specifies the OLE DB provider to use. For more information, see [OLE DB Connection Manager](../../integration-services/connection-manager/ole-db-connection-manager.md).  
  
 An [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] project also provides the data source object from which you can create an OLE DB connection manager. This makes data sources and data source views available to the SQL Server destination.  
  
 The SQL Server destination has one input. It does not support an error output.  
  
 You can set properties through [!INCLUDE[ssIS](../../includes/ssis-md.md)] Designer or programmatically.  
  
 The **Advanced Editor** dialog box reflects the properties that can be set programmatically. For more information about the properties that you can set in the **Advanced Editor** dialog box or programmatically, click one of the following topics:

## SQL Destination Editor (Connection Manager Page)
  Use the **Connection Manager** page of the **SQL Destination Editor** dialog box to specify data source information, and to preview the results. The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] destination loads data into tables or views in a [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] database.  
  
### Options  
 **OLE DB connection manager**  
 Select an existing connection from the list, or create a new connection by clicking **New**.  
  
 **New**  
 Create a new connection by using the **Configure OLE DB Connection Manager** dialog box.  
  
 **Use a table or view**  
 Select an existing table or view from the list, or create a new connection by clicking **New**.  
  
 **New**  
 Create a new table by using the **Create Table** dialog box.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  When you click **New**, [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] generates a default CREATE TABLE statement based on the connected data source. This default CREATE TABLE statement will not include the FILESTREAM attribute even if the source table includes a column with the FILESTREAM attribute declared. To run an [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] component with the FILESTREAM attribute, first implement FILESTREAM storage on the destination database. Then, add the FILESTREAM attribute to the CREATE TABLE statement in the **Create Table** dialog box. For more information, see [Binary Large Object &#40;Blob&#41; Data &#40;SQL Server&#41;](../../relational-databases/blob/binary-large-object-blob-data-sql-server.md).  
  
 **Preview**  
 Preview results by using the **Preview Query Results** dialog box. Preview can display up to 200 rows.  
  
## SQL Destination Editor (Mappings Page)
  Use the **Mappings** page of the **SQL Destination Editor** dialog box to map input columns to destination columns.
