# Package Management (SSIS Service)
  Package management includes monitoring, managing, importing and exporting packages.  
 
 ## Package Store  
 [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] provides two top-level folders for accessing packages: 
 - **Running Packages** 
 - **Stored Packages**

 The **Running Packages** folder lists the packages that are currently running on the server. The **Stored Packages** folder lists the packages that are saved in the package store. These are the only packages that the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] service manages. The package store can consist of either or both the msdb database and file system folders listed in the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] service configuration file. The configuration file specifies the msdb and file system folders to manage. You might also have packages stored elsewhere in the file system that are not managed by the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] service.  
  
 Packages you save to msdb are stored in a table named sysssispackages. When you save packages to msdb, you can group them in logical folders. Using logical folders can help you organize packages by purpose, or filter packages in the sysssispackages table. Create new logical folders in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)]. By default, any logical folders that you add to msdb are automatically included in the package store.  
  
 The logical folders you create are represented as rows in the sysssispackagefolders table in msdb. The folderid and parentfolderid columns in sysssispackagefolders define the folder hierarchy. The root logical folders in msdb are the rows in sysssispackagefolders with null values in the parentfolderid column. For more information, see [sysssispackages &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../relational-databases/system-tables/sysssispackages-transact-sql.md) and [sysssispackagefolders (Transact-SQL&)](../../relational-databases/system-tables/sysssispackagefolders-transact-sql.md).  
  
 When you open [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] and connect to [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)], you will see the msdb folders that [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] service manages listed within the Stored Packages folder. If the configuration file specifies root file system folders, the Stored Packages folder also lists packages saved to the file system in those folders and in all subfolders.  
  
 You can store packages in any file system folder, but they will not be listed in subfolders of the **Stored Packages** folder unless you add the folder to the list of folders in the configuration file for the package store. For more information about the configuration file, see [Integration Services Service &#40;SSIS Service&#41;](../../integration-services/service/integration-services-service-ssis-service.md).  
  
 The **Running Packages** folder contains no subfolders and it is not extensible.  
  
 By default, the **Stored Packages** folder contains two folders: **File System** and **MSDB**. The **File System** folder lists the packages that are saved to the file system. The location of these files is specified in the configuration file for the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] service. The default folder is the Packages folder, located in %Program Files%\Microsoft SQL Server\100\DTS. The **MSDB** folder lists the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] packages that have been saved to the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] msdb database on the server. The sysssispackages table contains the packages saved to msdb.  
  
 To view the list of packages in the package store, you must open [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] and connect to [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)].  
  
## Monitor running packages  
 The **Running Packages** folder lists packages currently running. To view information about current packages on the **Summary** page of [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)], click the **Running Packages** folder. Information such as the execution duration of running packages is listed on the **Summary** page. Optionally, refresh the folder to display the most current information.  
  
 To view information about a single running package on the **Summary** page, click the package. The **Summary** page displays information such as the version and description of the package.  
  
Stop a running package from the **Running Packages** folder by right-clicking the package and then clicking **Stop**.  
  
## View packages in SSMS
    
 This procedure describes how to connect to [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] and view a list of the packages that the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] service manages.  
  
### To connect to Integration Services  
  
1.  Click **Start**, point to **All Programs**, point to **Microsoft SQL Server**, and then click **SQL Server Management Studio**.  
  
2.  In the **Connect to Server** dialog box, select **Integration Services** in the **Server type** list, provide a server name in the **Server name** box, and then click **Connect**.  
  
    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    >  If you cannot connect to [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)], the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] service is likely not running. To learn the status of the service, click **Start**, point to **All Programs**, point to **Microsoft SQL Server**, point to **Configuration Tools**, and then click **SQL Server Configuration Manager**. In the left pane, click **SQL Server Services**. In the right pane, find the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] service. Start the service if it is not already running.  
  
     [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] opens. By default the Object Explorer window is open and positioned in the lower-left corner of the studio. If Object Explorer is not open, click **Object Explorer** on the **View** menu.  
  
### To view the packages that Integration Services service manages  
  
1.  In Object Explorer, expand the Stored Packages folder.  
  
2.  Expand the Stored Packages subfolders to show packages.  

## Import and export packages
 
 Packages can be saved either in the sysssispackages table in the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] msdb database or in the file system.  
  
 The package store, which is the logical storage that [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] service monitors and manages, can include both the msdb database and the file system folders specified in the configuration file for the [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] service.  
  
 You can import and export packages between the following storage types:  
  
-   File system folders anywhere in the file system.  
  
-   Folders in the SSIS Package Store. The two default folders are named File System and MSDB.  
  
-   The [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] msdb database.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] gives you the ability to import and export packages, and by doing this change the storage format and location of packages. Using the import and export features, you can add packages to the file system, package store, or msdb database, and copy packages from one storage format to another. For example, packages saved in msdb can be copied to the file system and vice versa.  
  
 You can also copy a package to a different format using the **dtutil** command prompt utility (dtutil.exe). For more information, see [dtutil Utility](../../integration-services/dtutil-utility.md).  
  
 You can import or export an [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] package from or to the following locations:  
  
-   You can import a package that is stored in an instance of [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], in the file system, or in the [!INCLUDE[ssIS](../../includes/ssis-md.md)] package store. The imported package is saved to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] or to a folder in the [!INCLUDE[ssIS](../../includes/ssis-md.md)] package store.  
  
-   You can export a package that is stored in an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], the file system, or the [!INCLUDE[ssIS](../../includes/ssis-md.md)] Package Store to a different storage format and location.  
  
 However, there are some restrictions on importing and exporting a package between different versions of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]:  
  
-   On an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../includes/sskatmai-md.md)], you can import packages from an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../includes/ssversion2005-md.md)], but you cannot export packages to an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../includes/ssversion2005-md.md)].  
  
-   On an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssVersion2005](../../includes/ssversion2005-md.md)], you cannot import packages from, or export packages to, an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../includes/sskatmai-md.md)].  
  
 The following procedures describe how to use [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] to import or export a package.

## Back up and restore packages
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] packages can be saved to the file system or msdb, a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] system database. Packages saved to msdb can be backed up and restored using [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] backup and restore features.  
  
 For more information about backing up and restoring the msdb database, click one of the following topics:  
  
-   [Back Up and Restore of SQL Server Databases](../../relational-databases/backup-restore/back-up-and-restore-of-sql-server-databases.md)  
  
-   [Back Up and Restore of System Databases &#40;SQL Server&#41;](../../relational-databases/backup-restore/back-up-and-restore-of-system-databases-sql-server.md)  
  
 [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] includes the **dtutil** command-prompt utility (dtutil.exec), which you can use to manage packages. For more information, see [dtutil Utility](../../integration-services/dtutil-utility.md).  
  
### Configuration Files  
 Any configuration files that the packages include are stored in the file system. These files are not backed up when you back up the msdb database; therefore, you should make sure that the configuration files are backed up regularly as part of your plan for securing packages saved to msdb. To include configurations in the backup of the msdb database, you should consider using the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] configuration type instead of file-based configurations.  
  
### Packages Stored in the File System  
 The backup of packages that are saved to the file system should be included in the plan for backing up the file system of the server. The [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] service configuration file, which has the default name MsDtsSrvr.ini.xml, lists the folders on the server that the service monitors. You should make sure these folders are backed up. Additionally, packages may be stored in other folders on the server and you should make sure to include these folders in the backup.
