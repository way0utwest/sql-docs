# Run an SSIS package from the command prompt with DTExec.exe
This quick start tutorial demonstrates how to run an SSIS package from the command prompt by running `DTExec.exe` with the appropriate parameters.

> [!NOTE]
> The method described in this article has not been tested with packages deployed to an Azure SQL Database server.

For more info about `DTExec.exe`, see [dtexec Utility](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/integration-services/packages/dtexec-utility).

## Run a package with dtexec

If the folder that contains `DTExec.exe` is not in your `path` environment variable, you may have to use the `cd` command to change to its directory. For SQL Server 2017, this folder is typically `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SQL Server\140\DTS\Binn`.

With the parameter values used in the following example, the program runs the package in the specified folder path on the SSIS server - that is, the server that hosts the SSIS Catalog database (SSISDB). The `/Server` parameter provides the server name. The program connects as the current user with Windows Integrated Authentication. To use SQL Authentication, specify the `/User` and `Password` parameters with appropriate values.

1. Open a Command Prompt window.

2. Run `DTExec.exe` and provide values at least for the `ISServer` and the `Server` parameters, as shown in the following example:

    ```cmd
    dtexec /ISServer "\SSISDB\Project1Folder\Integration Services Project1\Package.dtsx" /Server "localhost"
    ```
