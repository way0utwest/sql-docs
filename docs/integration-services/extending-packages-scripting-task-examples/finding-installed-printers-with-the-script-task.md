# Finding Installed Printers with the Script Task
  The data that is transformed by [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] packages often has a printed report as its final destination. The **System.Drawing.Printing** namespace in the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../includes/dnprdnshort-md.md)] provides classes for working with printers.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  If you want to create a task that you can more easily reuse across multiple packages, consider using the code in this Script task sample as the starting point for a custom task. For more information, see [Developing a Custom Task](../../integration-services/extending-packages-custom-objects/task/developing-a-custom-task.md).  
  
## Description  
 The following example locates printers installed on the server that support legal size paper (as used in the United States). The code to check supported paper sizes is encapsulated in a private function. To enable you to track the progress of the script as it checks the settings for each printer, the script uses the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Tasks.ScriptTask.ScriptObjectModel.Log%2A> method to raise an informational message for printers with legal size paper, and to raise a warning for printers without legal size paper. These messages appear in the **Output** window of the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] Tools for Applications (VSTA) IDE when you run the package in the designer.  
  
#### To configure this Script Task example  
  
1.  Create the variable named `PrinterList` with type **Object**.  
  
2.  On the **Script** page of the **Script Task Editor**, add this variable to the ReadWriteVariables property.  
  
3.  In the script project, add a reference to the **System.Drawing** namespace.  
  
4.  In your code, use **Imports** statements to import the **System.Collections** and the **System.Drawing.Printing** namespaces.  
  
### Code  
  
```vb  
Public Sub Main()  
  
    Dim printerName As String  
    Dim currentPrinter As New PrinterSettings  
    Dim size As PaperSize  
  
    Dim printerList As New ArrayList  
    For Each printerName In PrinterSettings.InstalledPrinters  
        currentPrinter.PrinterName = printerName  
        If PrinterHasLegalPaper(currentPrinter) Then  
            printerList.Add(printerName)  
            Dts.Events.FireInformation(0, "Example", _  
                "Printer " & printerName & " has legal paper.", _  
                String.Empty, 0, False)  
        Else  
            Dts.Events.FireWarning(0, "Example", _  
                "Printer " & printerName & " DOES NOT have legal paper.", _  
                String.Empty, 0)  
        End If  
    Next  
  
    Dts.Variables("PrinterList").Value = printerList  
  
    Dts.TaskResult = ScriptResults.Success  
  
End Sub  
  
Private Function PrinterHasLegalPaper( _  
    ByVal thisPrinter As PrinterSettings) As Boolean  
  
    Dim size As PaperSize  
    Dim hasLegal As Boolean = False  
  
    For Each size In thisPrinter.PaperSizes  
        If size.Kind = PaperKind.Legal Then  
            hasLegal = True  
        End If  
    Next  
  
    Return hasLegal  
  
End Function  
```  
  
```csharp

        {  
  
            PrinterSettings currentPrinter = new PrinterSettings();

            Boolean Flag = false;

            {  
                currentPrinter.PrinterName = printerName;  
                if (PrinterHasLegalPaper(currentPrinter))  
                {  
                    printerList.Add(printerName);  
                    Dts.Events.FireInformation(0, "Example", "Printer " + printerName + " has legal paper.", String.Empty, 0, ref Flag);  
                }  
                else  
                {  
                    Dts.Events.FireWarning(0, "Example", "Printer " + printerName + " DOES NOT have legal paper.", String.Empty, 0);  
                }  
            }  
  
            Dts.Variables["PrinterList"].Value = printerList;  
  
            Dts.TaskResult = (int)ScriptResults.Success;  
  
        }  
  
        private bool PrinterHasLegalPaper(PrinterSettings thisPrinter)  
        {  
  
            bool hasLegal = false;  
  
            foreach (PaperSize size in thisPrinter.PaperSizes)  
            {  
                if (size.Kind == PaperKind.Legal)  
                {  
                    hasLegal = true;  
                }  
            }  
  
            return hasLegal;  
  
        }
