# Integration Services (SSIS) Scale Out Master
The Scale Out Master manages the Scale Out system through the SSISDB Catalog and the Scale Out Master service. 

The SSISDB Catalog stores all the information for Scale Out Workers, packages, and executions. It provides the interface to enable a Scale Out Worker and execute packages in Scale Out. For more information, see [Walkthrough: Set up Integration Services Scale Out](walkthrough-set-up-integration-services-scale-out.md) and [Run Packages in Integration Services](run-packages-in-integration-services-ssis-scale-out.md).

The Scale Out Master service is a Windows service that is responsible for the communication with Scale Out Workers. It returns the status of package executions on Scale Out Workers over HTTPS and operates on the data in SSISDB.

## Configure the Scale Out Master service
You configure the Scale Out Master service by using the `\<drive\>:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\140\DTS\Binn\MasterSettings.config` file. You have to restart the service after updating the configuration file.
