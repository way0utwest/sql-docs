# Integration Services (SSIS) Scale Out Worker

The Scale Out Worker runs the Scale Out Worker service to pull execution tasks from Scale Out Master. Then the worker runs the packages locally with `ISServerExec.exe`.

## Configure the Scale Out Worker service
You can configure the Scale Out Worker service by using the` \<drive\>:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\140\DTS\Binn\WorkerSettings.config` file. You have to restart the service after updating the configuration file.

## View the Scale Out Worker log
The log file of the Scale Out Worker service is in the `\<drive\>:\Users\\[account]\AppData\Local\SSIS\ScaleOut\Agent` folder.

The log location of each individual task is configured in the `WorkerSettings.config` file in the `TasksRootFolder`. If a value is not specified, the log is in the `\<drive\>:\Users\\[account]\AppData\Local\SSIS\ScaleOut\Tasks` folder. 

The *[account]* parameter is the account running the Scale Out Worker service. By default, the account is `SSISScaleOutWorker140`.
