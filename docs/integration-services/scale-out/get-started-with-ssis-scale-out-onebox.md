Finish the SQL Server installation Wizard.

## 2. Install SQL Server Management Studio

Download and install [SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)](../../ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms.md).

## 3. Enable Scale Out
Open SSMS and connect to the local Sql Server instance.
In Object Explorer, right-click **Integration Services Catalogs** and select **Create Catalog**.

In the **Create Catalog** dialog, the option **Enable this server as SSIS scale out master** is selected by default.

## 4. Enable a Scale Out Worker
In SSMS, right-click **SSISDB** and select **Manage Scale Out**.

To enable a Scale Out Worker, switch to **Worker Manager** and select the worker you want to enable. The workers are disabled by default. Click **Enable Worker** to enable the selected worker.

## 5. Run packages in Scale Out
