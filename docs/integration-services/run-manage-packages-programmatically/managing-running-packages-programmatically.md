# Managing Running Packages Programmatically
  As you work programmatically with [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] packages, you may want to determine which packages are currently running. The <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.Application> class of the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime> namespace provides methods and classes to satisfy these requirements.  
  
 For more information about monitoring packages, see [Package Management &#40;SSIS Service&#41;](../../integration-services/service/package-management-ssis-service.md).  
  
 All the methods discussed in this topic require a reference to the **Microsoft.SqlServer.ManagedDTS** assembly. After you add the reference in a new project, import the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime> namespace with a **using** or **Imports** statement.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  The methods of the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.Application> class for working with the SSIS Package Store support only ".", localhost, or the server name for the local server. You cannot use "(local)".  
  
## Determining Which Packages Are Currently Running  
 To determine which packages are currently running on the specified server, call the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.Application.GetRunningPackages%2A> method. This method returns a <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.RunningPackages> collection of <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.RunningPackage> objects.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Administrators see all packages that are currently executing on the computer; other users see only those packages that they have launched.  
  
## Working with Running Packages  
 After you have determined which packages are currently running, you can retrieve information about the packages and request that a package be stopped.  
  
### Getting Information about a Running Package  
 As you iterate through the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.RunningPackages> collection, you can use the properties of the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.RunningPackage> object to locate a package or to obtain additional information about the packages that are running:  
  
-   <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.RunningPackage.ExecutionDuration%2A>  
  
-   <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.RunningPackage.ExecutionStartTime%2A>  
  
-   <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.RunningPackage.InstanceID%2A>  
  
-   <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.RunningPackage.PackageDescription%2A>  
  
-   <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.RunningPackage.PackageID%2A>  
  
-   <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.RunningPackage.PackageName%2A>  
  
-   <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.RunningPackage.UserName%2A>  
  
### Stopping a Running Package  
 You can call the <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.RunningPackage.Stop%2A> method of a <xref:Microsoft.SqlServer.Dts.Runtime.RunningPackage> object to request that the package be stopped. There may be a delay between the time that a stop request is issued and the time that the package actually stops.
