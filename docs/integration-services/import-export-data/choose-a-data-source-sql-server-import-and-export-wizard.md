# Choose a Data Source (SQL Server Import and Export Wizard)
  After the Welcome page, the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Import and Export Wizard shows **Choose a Data Source**. On this page, you provide info about the source of your data and about how to connect to it.
  
For info about the data sources that you can use, see [What data sources and destinations can I use?](../../integration-services/import-export-data/import-and-export-data-with-the-sql-server-import-and-export-wizard.md#wizardSources)

## Screen shot of the Choose a Data Source page 
The following screen shot shows the first part of the **Choose a Data Source** page of the wizard. The rest of the  page has a variable number of options which depend on the data source that you choose here.

![Choose source](../../integration-services/import-export-data/media/choose-source.png)

## Choose a data source
 **Data source**  
Specify the data source by selecting a data provider that can connect to the source.

-   **The data provider that you need is typically obvious from its name**, because the name of the provider typically contains the name of the data source - for example, *Flat File* Source, Microsoft *Excel*, Microsoft *Access*, .Net Framework Data Provider for *SqlServer*, .Net Framework Data Provider for *Oracle*.

-   **If you have an ODBC driver for your data source**, select the .Net Framework Data Provider for ODBC. Then enter the driver-specific info. ODBC drivers aren't listed in the drop-down list of data sources. The .Net Framework Data Provider for ODBC acts as a wrapper around the ODBC driver. For more info, see [Connect to an ODBC Data Source](../../integration-services/import-export-data/connect-to-an-odbc-data-source-sql-server-import-and-export-wizard.md).

-   **There may be more than one provider available for your data source.** Typically you can select any provider that works with your source. For example, to connect to Microsoft [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], you can use the .NET Framework Data Provider for SQL Server or the SQL Server ODBC driver. (Other providers are also still in the list but are no longer supported.) 

## My data source isn't in the list
-   **You may have to download the data provider** from Microsoft or from a third party. The list of available data providers in the **Data source** list includes only the providers installed on your computer. For info about the data sources that you can use, see [What data sources and destinations can I use?](import-and-export-data-with-the-sql-server-import-and-export-wizard.md#wizardSources)

-   **Do you have an ODBC driver for your data source?** ODBC drivers aren't listed in the drop-down list of data sources. If you have an ODBC driver for your data source, select the .Net Framework Data Provider for ODBC. Then enter the driver-specific info. The .Net Framework Data Provider for ODBC acts as a wrapper around the ODBC driver. For more info, see [Connect to an ODBC Data Source](../../integration-services/import-export-data/connect-to-an-odbc-data-source-sql-server-import-and-export-wizard.md).

-   **64-bit and 32-bit providers.** If you're running the 64-bit wizard, you won't see data sources for which only a 32-bit provider is installed, and vice versa.

> [!NOTE]
> To use the 64-bit version of the SQL Server Import and Export Wizard, you have to install SQL Server. SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) and SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) are 32-bit applications and only install 32-bit files, including the 32-bit version of the wizard.

## After you choose a data source
After you choose a data source, the rest of the **Choose a Data Source** page has a variable number of options which depend on the data provider that you choose.

To connect to a commonly used data source, see one of the following pages.
-   [Connect to SQL Server](../../integration-services/import-export-data/connect-to-a-sql-server-data-source-sql-server-import-and-export-wizard.md)
-   [Connect to Oracle](../../integration-services/import-export-data/connect-to-an-oracle-data-source-sql-server-import-and-export-wizard.md)
-   [Connect to flat files (text files)](../../integration-services/import-export-data/connect-to-a-flat-file-data-source-sql-server-import-and-export-wizard.md)
-   [Connect to Excel](../../integration-services/import-export-data/connect-to-an-excel-data-source-sql-server-import-and-export-wizard.md)
-   [Connect to Access](../../integration-services/import-export-data/connect-to-an-access-data-source-sql-server-import-and-export-wizard.md)
-   [Connect with ODBC](../../integration-services/import-export-data/connect-to-an-odbc-data-source-sql-server-import-and-export-wizard.md)
-   [Connect to Azure Blob Storage](../../integration-services/import-export-data/connect-to-azure-blob-storage-sql-server-import-and-export-wizard.md)
-   [Connect to PostgreSQL](../../integration-services/import-export-data/connect-to-a-postgresql-data-source-sql-server-import-and-export-wizard.md)
-   [Connect to MySQL](../../integration-services/import-export-data/connect-to-a-mysql-data-source-sql-server-import-and-export-wizard.md)

For info about how to connect to a data source that's not listed here, see [The Connection Strings Reference](https://www.connectionstrings.com/). This third-party site contains sample connection strings and more info about data providers and the connection info they require.

## What's next?  
 After you provide info about the source of your data and about how to connect to it, the next page is **Choose a Destination**. On this page, you provide info about the destination for your data and about how to connect to it. For more info, see [Choose a Destination](../../integration-services/import-export-data/choose-a-destination-sql-server-import-and-export-wizard.md).
