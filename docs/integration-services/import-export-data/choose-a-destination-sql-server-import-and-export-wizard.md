# Choose a Destination (SQL Server Import and Export Wizard)
 After you provide info about the source of your data and about how to connect to it, the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Import and Export Wizard shows **Choose a Destination**. On this page, you provide info about the destination for your data and about how to connect to it.
  
For info about the data destinations that you can use, see [What data sources and destinations can I use?](import-and-export-data-with-the-sql-server-import-and-export-wizard.md#wizardSources). 

## Screen shot of the Destination page
The following screen shot shows the first part of the **Choose a Destination** page of the wizard. The rest of the page has a variable number of options which depend on the destination that you choose here.

![Choose destination](../../integration-services/import-export-data/media/choose-destination.png)

## Choose a destination
 **Destination**  
 Specify the destination by selecting a data provider that can import data into the destination.
 
-   **The data provider that you need is typically obvious from its name**, because the name of the provider typically contains the name of the destination - for example, *Flat File* Destination, Microsoft *Excel*, Microsoft *Access*, .Net Framework Data Provider for *SqlServer*, .Net Framework Data Provider for *Oracle*.

-   **If you have an ODBC driver for your destination**, select the .Net Framework Data Provider for ODBC. Then enter the driver-specific info. ODBC drivers aren't listed in the drop-down list of destinations. The .Net Framework Data Provider for ODBC acts as a wrapper around the ODBC driver. For more info, see [Connect to an ODBC Data Source](../../integration-services/import-export-data/connect-to-an-odbc-data-source-sql-server-import-and-export-wizard.md).

-   **There may be more than one provider available for your destination.** Typically you can select any provider that works with your destination. For example, to connect to Microsoft [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], you can use the .NET Framework Data Provider for SQL Server or the SQL Server ODBC driver. (Other providers are also still in the list but are no longer supported.) 

## My destination isn't in the list
-   **You may have to download the data provider** from Microsoft or from a third party. The list of available data providers in the **Destination** list includes only the providers installed on your computer. For info about the destinations that you can use, see [What data sources and destinations can I use?](import-and-export-data-with-the-sql-server-import-and-export-wizard.md#wizardSources)

-   **Do you have an ODBC driver for your destination?** ODBC drivers aren't listed in the drop-down list of destinations. If you have an ODBC driver for your destination, select the .Net Framework Data Provider for ODBC. Then enter the driver-specific info. The .Net Framework Data Provider for ODBC acts as a wrapper around the ODBC driver. For more info, see [Connect to an ODBC Data Source](../../integration-services/import-export-data/connect-to-an-odbc-data-source-sql-server-import-and-export-wizard.md).

-   **64-bit and 32-bit providers.** If you're running the 64-bit wizard, you won't see destinations for which only a 32-bit provider is installed, and vice versa.

> [!NOTE]
> To use the 64-bit version of the SQL Server Import and Export Wizard, you have to install SQL Server. SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) and SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) are 32-bit applications and only install 32-bit files, including the 32-bit version of the wizard.

## After you choose a destination
After you choose a destination, the rest of the **Choose a Destination** page has a variable number of options which depend on the data provider that you choose.

To connect to a commonly used destination, see one of the following pages.
-   [Connect to SQL Server](../../integration-services/import-export-data/connect-to-a-sql-server-data-source-sql-server-import-and-export-wizard.md)
-   [Connect to Oracle](../../integration-services/import-export-data/connect-to-an-oracle-data-source-sql-server-import-and-export-wizard.md)
-   [Connect to flat files (text files)](../../integration-services/import-export-data/connect-to-a-flat-file-data-source-sql-server-import-and-export-wizard.md)
-   [Connect to Excel](../../integration-services/import-export-data/connect-to-an-excel-data-source-sql-server-import-and-export-wizard.md)
-   [Connect to Access](../../integration-services/import-export-data/connect-to-an-access-data-source-sql-server-import-and-export-wizard.md)
-   [Connect with ODBC](../../integration-services/import-export-data/connect-to-an-odbc-data-source-sql-server-import-and-export-wizard.md)
-   [Connect to Azure Blob Storage](../../integration-services/import-export-data/connect-to-azure-blob-storage-sql-server-import-and-export-wizard.md)
-   [Connect to PostgreSQL](../../integration-services/import-export-data/connect-to-a-postgresql-data-source-sql-server-import-and-export-wizard.md)
-   [Connect to MySQL](../../integration-services/import-export-data/connect-to-a-mysql-data-source-sql-server-import-and-export-wizard.md)

For info about how to connect to a destination that's not listed here, see [The Connection Strings Reference](https://www.connectionstrings.com/). This third-party site contains sample connection strings and more info about data providers and the connection info they require.

## What's next?  
 After you provide info about the destination for your data and about how to connect to it, the next page is **Specify Table Copy or Query**. On this page, you specify whether you want to copy an entire table or only certain rows. For more info, see [Specify Table Copy or Query](../../integration-services/import-export-data/specify-table-copy-or-query-sql-server-import-and-export-wizard.md).
