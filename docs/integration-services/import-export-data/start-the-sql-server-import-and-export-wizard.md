# Start the SQL Server Import and Export Wizard

 > For content related to previous versions of SQL Server, see [Run the SQL Server Import and Export Wizard](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms140052(SQL.120).aspx).

Start the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Import and Export Wizard in one of the ways described in this topic to import data from and export data to any supported data source.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This topic describes only how to **start** the wizard. If you're looking for something else, see [Related tasks and content](#related).

You can start the wizard:
-   From the [Start menu](#startStart).
-   From the [command prompt](#startCmd). 
-   From [SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)](#startSSMS).
-   From [Visual Studio with SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT)](#startVS).

## Prerequisite - Is the wizard installed on your computer?
If you want to run the wizard, but you don't have [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] installed on your computer, you can install the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Import and Export Wizard  by installing SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT). For more info, see [Download SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt204009.aspx).
